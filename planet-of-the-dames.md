# Planet Of The Dames

> Act 1 Scene 1

[On the Planet of the Dames]

Damebots march up aisle and then FOC "We are the Dame-Bots"

Dan Lothario: {rummaging through a suitcase full of black-market stuff, pauses for a moment as he realises he's not alone, sees audience, slams case shut} I say, you frightened the life out of me. Which planet did you all come from? {maybe audience participation/banter Earth??? Never heard of it etc? Then re-opens the suitcase}. Perhaps I could interest you in some bottles of gin I've, erm, "managed to acquire". No, maybe some disposable vapes, I've got watermelon or rhubarb and beef. No, how about some genuine fake Rolex watches? No? Ah well, suit yourselves. Oh, where ARE my manners, allow me to introduce my very good self. I am Captain Dan Lothario, I'm an intergalactic business man, I deal in a bit of this, a bit of that... a bit of the other, if you understand my meaning ladies??? Oh yes, I'm very well respected across many of the most sophisticated planets around here. I've been to, oh, what's the one with the rings round it? That's right, Suttern. And that poxy little one down there... Macc-ury. Oh, and I've just come back from Uranus. I'm here to sell some of my extra special cosmetics to some exquisite ladies... Oh... here they come... wish me luck... Showtime!!! {he clicks his fingers, freezes and the lights switch to 2 Dames who enter, loudly bantering with each other, arguing over which is the most beautiful}

D1: Look, I'm not being funny...

D2: No change there then!!!

D1: ...I'm NOT BEING FUNNY, but it's obvious that I'm the prettiest Dame on this planet.

D2: I think you'll find that I'm FAR prettier than you, all the men round here agree.

D1: Men? What men? There ARE no men on this planet... just us ladies... {simpers, flutters eyelashes etc}

D2: Well then what's HE doing here {points to DL, who immediately unfreezes}

D1: Oh my goodness... it's a man, and a pretty good looking one at that. Where did he come from?

D2: Never mind where he came from, he's mine, I'll seduce him with my womanly ways...

D1: No, no, no, no, no, that's NOT what's going to happen. I saw him first, he's mine. And besides, as I was just pointing out, I'M the prettiest Dame on this planet. I took first place at the Alpha Centurai beauty contest.

D2: That wasn't a beauty contest, it was an agriculture show. {To the audience} She won the Aberdeen Angus category!

{cue slapping and arguing}

D1: Well, there's only one way to settle this...

D2: You don't mean

D1: Yes... we've got ourselves a Flirt-off! {Cue flirting, simpering, crotch-thrusting, whatever... towards DL who snaps back to life}

Dan Lothario: {once the flirting has finished} My my, aren't you the most enchanting maidens I've had the good fortune to lay my eyes upon?
{giggling from Dames, followed by violent agreement over how beautiful they both are, but then turning into argument over who is MOST beautiful. D1 decides to take the initiative...}

D1: I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

Dan Lothario: {to the audience} That doesn't surprise me.

D2: {pushing D1 out of the way} But I'd like to...

D1: {pushing D2 back out of the way} Allow me to ingratiate (interrogate) myself with yourself. I'm Florence and, as well as being the prettiest Dame on this planet, I'm also in charge of things.

D2: Woah, woah, woah there droopy drawers, i'm Beatrice, I'M in charge, and {looking pointedly at D1} I'm the prettiest.

Dan Lothario: Well, I'm Captain Dan Lothario, and it's an absolute delight to meet you both. And may I say you both look absolutely smashing in your outfits, they certainly, flatter your, ample figures. I honestly don't think I could choose between either of you {grimaces at audience}.

{More simpering from Dames}

Dan Lothario: But hold on... {sniffs the air around them} What IS that smell? {Dames sniff their own armpits, each other etc}

D2: {puzzled} I can't smell 'owt

D1: Me neither.

Dan Lothario: Well THAT'S the problem. Two fabulous looking ladies like yourselves deserve a certain Je ne sais quoi

D1: A Gin and say whatsit?

D2: Ohhh, I like the sound of that, 2 pints of Gin and a packet of cheesy Wotsits please!

Dan Lothario: {spelling it out for them} Je... Ne... Sais... Quoi...

D1: I think it's German

D2: Which planet's that?

Dan Lothario: You need an eau-de-toillette.

D1: No thanks, I went before I came on stage.

D2: She did... {to the audience, screwing up her face} I heard...

Dan Lothario: Oh good lord, have you not heard of cologne?

D1: Oh that's definitely in Germany

D2: Oooooh, you're SO good on geology!

Dan Lothario: May I enquire where do you fine ladies purchase olfactory delights?

D1: {looking puzzled} Well, Ethel down the street runs the butchers, if that's what you mean?

Dan Lothario: I mean who satisfies your perfumery requirements.

D2: {to D1} He's making no scents!

D1: {to the audience}... making no scents!!! Get it... scents... no? Oh, you're in for a long night!

Dan Lothario: well this is your lucky day ladies. Amongst other things, I happen to be the exclusive representative for one of the most sought after perfume brands in the universe. Just a small spray of my product will have the gentlemen flocking round.

D2: {to D1, looking a little concerned} what did he say Florence?

D1: Flocking Beatrice... flocking!

Dan Lothario: Now this IS extremely exclusive, so it's rather pricey... but you seem like the kind of classy ladies who don't worry about that sort of thing.

D1: {putting on posh voices} Oh no, we're very upmarket... I once knew someone from the Wilmslow galaxy.

D2: {trying to be even posher} And I've been to Leek.

D1: {looking down at D2's feet} what, just now... could you not have waited until the end of this scene? {realising her mistake} oh, I see, Leek, sorry.

Dan Lothario: Allow me to introduce you to Faybrehze pour Femme. {takes out a large squirty bottle labelled Febreeze and proceeds to squirt them both. They're both taken aback, don't seem to appreciate the smell, and start imploring him to stop. He takes another sniff in their general direction}. Oh, MUCH better, my I'm getting URGES just inhaling your aroma.

D1: Well let those urges spring forth Danny Boy, let em out.

Dan Lothario: If I wasn't such a gentleman...

D2: well WE won't tell anyone, will we Florence?

Dan Lothario: Sadly I have other appointments in the Langley Constellation, and you know how stylish the ladies are there. I'd hate them to have all of this Faybreaze to themselves... shall I put you down for, say... 23 gallons?

D1: {to D2} do you think that'll be enough?

D2: make it 25 gallons and give us a couple of bottles of that GeNeSaysQuaz stuff you drink.

Dan Lothario: excellent, it's cash only, I'm afraid {handing them an invoice. They both look shocked, and splutter about it being a bit steep etc, but then, aware that they've made out how posh they are, scrape around in their pockets and manage to pull together the requisite cash, which they hand over, slightly reluctantly}. A pleasure doing business with you absolute babes. Au revoir, as they say... {shrugging at the audience} in Germany. {he exits}

D1: Well, he was a bit of alright

D2: What a charmer, he definitely fancied me...

{More Dames enter loudly, some only partially made up, arguing}

D3: Cultured... you??? I've seen more culture in a tub of yogurt!

D4: How dare you, I was in the ballet.

D3: Which one was it... Swan CAKE???? Ha, ha, ha, eughhhh, what IS that smell?

D4: It smells like a badger's exploded

D3: It's burning my eyes.

D1: What do you think girls, how do you like our new, perfume?

D2: It's called Faybrehhzzzz.

D3: It's awful

D4: It stinks

D3: It's still burning my eyes

D1: Oh you're just jealous cos we smell divine, and you don't

D2: We'll have men falling at our feet

D3: I wouldn't be at all surprised. You'll poison them with THEM fumes!

D4: Where DID you get that noxious abomination from?

D1: A very tasty gentleman, Captain Dan Lothario sold it to us. I think he quite fancied me.

D2: He says the ladies on Langley are mad for this stuff, and you know how cosmopolitan they are!

D3: Langley, you say?

D4: Give us some of that!

D3: {eyes screwed shut} Spray it on my face!!!

D1: {begins to spray, but then notices D3 has a 5-o-clock shadow} Are you starting to grow... A BEARD??? {everyone else gathers round to look and agrees that seems to be the case}

D4: Well, YOUR voice seems to be getting a lot deeper!

D2: I must admit, I seem to be struggling to keep up with my leg-shaving recently

D3: Oh, it's YOU who pinched my Black And Decker Strimmer is it... I was wondering why I couldn't find it

D2: Well what's going on? Why are we becoming less...feminine?

D1: well we know what keeps us looking gorgeous and ladylike...

Everyone: BLUE EYESHADOW!

D1: Exactly, Igor!!! {a servant shuffles on}. Go to the makeup warehouse and bring us some more blue eyeshadow. {he shuffles off}

D2: Good thinking Florence, I've completely run out of it

D3: Me too

D4: and me

Igor: {returning} My Queen, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but there is no blue eyeshadow left. {da da daaaaaa}

D1: I bet SHE's used it all

D2: That Layabout!

D3: Oh that's TYPICAL of her

D4: Why did we ever agree to take her in when she was a baby?

D2: She's nothing but trouble

D3: selfish

D4: and lazy!

D1: well this is the final straw, {shouting offstage} Damebots... bring that Layabout out here.

{the Dames all look angrily at each other. Two Damebots drag Princess Layabout on stage. One of the Dames takes the towel off her head and replaces it with a badly made judge's wig}

D3: By the authority vested in me by the sisterhood of Dames, I, Jackie Weaver, declare the commencement of this court hearing.

Princess Layabout: You have no authority here Jackie Weaver!

D3: Silence in court! Princess Denise Layabout, you stand accused of stealing blue eyeshadow with a market value of 7 million lunabucks(???). How do you plead?

Princess Layabout: Why would I steal yer eyeshadow, I don't need eyeshadow, I don't need ANY makeup, I'm just naturally attractive, unlike you freaks {gasps of horror from the other Dames}

D2: {to the audience} I hardly need any makeup either, just a little foundation and my blue eyeshadow and I look fabulous

Princess Layabout: do me a favour, you've got a cement mixer in your room, you trowel it on...

D3: Silence! I call the first witness for the prosecution.

D1: Thankyou m'lady. Calling Gertrude Scuttle. {Gertrude steps forward} You are Gertrude Matilda Scuttle.

D4: I am.

D1: And when did you last see your blue eyeshadow.

D4: Well, I left it out on the side just before SHE came in, and when she left... it was GONE! {gasps, tuts etc from Dames}

D1: No further questions your honour

D3: Any words for the defence {Layabout looks around and realises she has no legal counsel}

D2: Get on with it, Strictly's on in ten minutes!!!

Princess Layabout: I dunno why yer all so cruel to me, you've never liked me, never paid me any attention, never brought me up proper... you're the worst step-parents a girl could ever have... And you all... LOOK LIKE MEN!!!!

{more gasps of outrage}

D3: Silence in court! I have heard the evidence and it is most damning. You are a lazy, bad-mannered, insolent young lady. And following this disgraceful crime you appear to show no remorse. I find you guilty in the eyes of this court and sentence you, to life imprisonment... Take her away.

{Damebots march her offstage, Igor buggers off while she screams abuse back, Igor follows}

D3: Ooooooh, that felt good didn't it? I felt like a proper judge and everything.

D1: You were very stern Jackie, I loved the "Silence in court" bit.

D2: {to D1} well your prosecuting skills were very impressive...

D1: D'ya think so? I wasn't sure if it was a bit much...

D4: So what do we do with her?

D1: Send her to prison

D2: A really horrible prison

D4: You don't mean

D3: Yes, I sentence her to life on the prison planet... Farton

{Other Dames screw up their noses, knowing what Farton smells like}

D2: this is all well and good, but without blue shadow, we're all going to turn into men.

TRAGEDY

D1: {addressing one of the Damebots} Damebot... how do you make blue eyeshadow?

Damebot: It is made from Derbyshire Spar, commonly known as Blue John

D2: Ooooh, Blue John, I'd like to meet him!

D3: Quiet, Beatrice... Where do we find Blue John?

Damebot: It is only found in the Blue John Cavern

D4: And where's that

Damebot: Eaaaarth

All Dames: Eaaaaaaarthhhhh?

D2: Eugh, that sounds horrible. Right well, order us some more from Eaaaaarth...

Damebot: This is impossible. Earth has recently left the Common Galactic Trading Federation and they can no longer export their goods.

{Dames all look at each other in disbelief}

D1: Right then, there's only one thing for it, no one will stand in our way, we will destroy everything in our path. We will... invade Eaaaaaarth! {Big sound effect/music/Darth Vader march}

{Curtains close, Front of Curtain we see Obi Wan Big Bogie and Igor. OWBB is partially shrouded in a hooded cape}

OWBB: You have intelligence for me?

Igor: {whispers} Layabout... Eyeshadow... Guilty... Invasion!

OWBB: I see. Thank-you Igor, you are a true friend of The Force. It seems The Dames have taken things too far this time. The balance of good and evil is tipping. The time has come to re-unite the Jedi and fulfill the prophecy.

{they bow to each other and both leave through curtain}

25 mins?

> Act 1 Scene 2

[Suey and Calamity's living room]

{Mr Suey is dressed as he was last year but with the addition of a little lacy pinnie. He also has a feather duster and is clearly doing his housework. Calamity is never seen, only heard from offstage}

Calamity: Suey, have you finished dusting my nick-nacks?

Suey: Nearly love...

Calamity: Well you be sure not to miss anything, some of my nick-nacks were filthy after you did it last week. And don't forget to take out the trash.

Suey: I won't {he's getting annoyed, then spots the audience}. Calam? Are you expecting visitors?

Calamity: {not really paying attention} What!?!?

Suey: Hiya, you must be that lot from last year, I guess you saw me in the panto and liked me so much you wanted more? {bit of banter with audience} Well some of you must remember me? I was the big hero {he looks down and realises he's wearing his pinnie, which he takes off and throws away hoping no-one has noticed}... I saved the day, can't believe some of you don't know who I am. No... Well I'm Mr Suey, last time some of you were here I was working as a henchman for a really bad fella, but I gave it up for a woman {nods offstage to where Calamity is}. She can be a bit bossy, and she does nag me, and she's always picking fault with what I do, but, you know, I'm the one in charge round here... {he's distracted by a loud screeching and a crash}. What in the name of Ringo Starr was that????

{the sound of voices offstage}

OWBB: I keep telling you Courtney, use your wing-mirrors, and signal before making a right turn.

Courtney: I did all of that master, but that pigeon came out of nowhere...

OWBB: Oh Courtney, I really don't know how I manage to keep my patience with you, go and check if you've damaged anything while I deal with our business here {there's a knock at the door, and Suey goes to answer. OWBB strides in}. Good morning Mr Suey, it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

Suey: Eh, what, who are you? How do you know my name?

OWBB: I know everything about you Mr Suey. I know you were found as a baby on the doorstep of a Chinese Takeaway in Birkenhead. You were raised as a Liverpool supporter. Your favourite chocolate bar is the Curly Whirly. You have an squirrel-shaped birthmark on your left but...

Suey: OK, OK, I get it you know all about me. I'm just a scouse ex-henchman who's bad at dusting, so what?

OWBB: You are not who you think you are Mr Suey, allow me to explain. {4 hours pass}... you see?

Suey: So I'm a Jedi, I have special powers...why tell me now?

OWBB: An intergalactic war is on the horizon and you are our only hope.

Suey: Well let's go get em, whoever they are.

OWBB: Patience, Mr Suey... One young Jedi will not be enough to overcome the dark powers of this evil coven... there is another from your family that we must find.

Suey: Wow, you mean I've got a brother???

OWBB: Not, exactly.

{Courtney enters}

Courtney: I Found these 2 things hanging off the tree we crashed into. {he's holding a bag of dog poo and a wing mirror}

OWBB: YOU crashed in to Courtney... Well that's one of the wing mirrors

Courtney: Oh, is it important?

OWBB: Clearly not, you never seem to use them.

Courtney: and this was hanging in the tree too...

OWBB: {examining it more closely} It appears to be some Canine Organic Matter, there must be some good reason it was left hanging in a tree. You should keep hold of it in case it becomes useful. Come on Mr Suey, follow us, we need to travel to the remote space outpost Flash {ahahhh... they all look up and around trying to work out where the noise came from}.

Suey: Calamity love, I'm just off out for a bit.

Calamity: Don't forget to get my boil cream...

{curtains close as they leave}

> Act 1 Scene 3

Dorothy: Oh I'm looking forward to this Ken, I've never been in a cave before.

Ken: Well Dorothy, the thing with caves is they can be quite small, and it looks like there's an awful lot of people coming on this tour with us. Look at 'em. Are you ALL here for the tour? I say, are you all here for the tour? Honestly some of them seem a bit simple!

Dorothy: Ken!!!!!

Ken: Look at that young lad there, he's got long hair - could do with a trip to the barber's him... short back n sides.

Dorothy: Shhhh Ken... Ohh look, this must be our guide. He looks like a proper adventurer, like that Bear Grylls.

Ken: Lad looks like he couldn't explore his way out of a paper bag.

Bearass: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, my name is Bearathhh and I will be your guide today.

Ken: Sorry son, did you say bear arse?

Bearass: No! Bearathhhhh... my father was Spanish.

Dorothy: Ooooooh, Spanish, how exotic, did you hear that Ken, his father was Spanish.

Ken: I don't trust the Spaniards... I don't trust ANY kind of foreigners.

Dorothy: {sadly} I know you don't Ken... I know you don't. Well, I'm Dorothy, and this is my husband, Ken.

Bearass: This morning I shall be taking you deep beneath the surface of the earth, the final frontier, we'll boldly go where no one has gone before!

Ken: So this is the first time you've ever done this tour then lad?

Bearass: {confused} No... we've been doing this tour 5 times a day for years...

Ken: Well, you've already got my back up then fella-mi-lad... "Where no one's gone before", false advertising... I could have you for that.

Dorothy: quiet Ken, let the nice young man speak

Bearass: We shall go on a journey down into the Blue John Cavern, a place of mystery and wonder...

Ken: Well, it had better be good, the price we paid, nearly 5 pound each...

Dorothy: Oh shush Ken, we got vouchers out of the newspaper. {to Bearass} we're retired you see. Ken used to be an engineer, but he had to stop, what with his hearing and everything

Ken: I invented the Flipomater... {Bearass looks non-plussed} No? Honestly, the young people these days, they know nothing. It's the machine that sticks the lids on jars of jam. Oh, no wonder the country's going to the dogs!

Dorothy: Ken!

Bearass: Now as we descend into the depths of the cavern, the floor can become rather slippy, so please, watch your step Ken

Ken: Don't tell me what to do son, I worked for Kellogs for 15 years! If I want to fall over, I'll flipping well fall over.

Dorothy: {to Bearass} We'll be careful love {slaps Ken's arm. They move carefully to the other side of the stage}

Bearass: So we are now in the heart of the Blue John Cavern...

Dorothy: {pointing at some spiky rocks sticking out of the ground} what are those?

Bearass: Ah, excellent question Dorothy... Those are stalagmites, they form as deposits of calcium carbonate are precipitated from the cave ceiling.

Ken: I was going to say that...

Dorothy: And what about these {pointing at a pair of tights dangling from above}?

Ken: {interrupting to appear clever} Ah, I expect those are stalactites, formed by the solution of colloidial limestone particles forming a speleotherm over a period of millions of years.

Bearass: Actually Ken, this is just where I hang my washing, Blue John is surprisingly good at absorbing moisture.

Dorothy: Oh, that's interesting isn't it Ken? {to Bearass} I've got a tumble dryer myself.

Ken: It's a Hotpoint, very reliable. Not like some of these German appliances...

Bearass: {starting to get annoyed with Ken} The other thing you may not know about the Blue John stone is that it purifies the atmosphere. Just take a deep breath, I doubt you've ever experienced such clean air in all your... {fart noise, Bearass screws up his face in disgust}

Ken: Oh... sorry... that was me. I had a sausage roll in your visitor centre and it didn't agree with me.

Dorothy: He shouldn't have pastry, he's got a condition.

Ken: It's not a condition Dorothy, I just have an extremely efficient digestive system.

Dorothy: Mmmmm.

Bearass: If we could just get back to the tour... Now I have a piece of Blue John here, see how smooth it is...

Ken: Let's have a look at that son...

Dorothy: Don't touch it Ken... it's dangerous... I read in the paper that Blue John can send people quite mad.

Ken: Don't be silly Dorothy!

Dorothy: Well Brenda from the WI had some Blue John earrings, and she fell over in Sainsburys {to Bearass} into the carrots.

Ken: {rolling his eyes} She's 97 Dorothy... and she'd been drinking sherry all morning at The Bridge Club.

Dorothy: Well, I'm just saying... You can't be too careful!

Bearass: Again, if we could just stick to the tour. I'm going to ask you to switch off your torches, and we'll see just how dark it is down here.

Dorothy: Oh Ken, I don't think I like the idea of being down her in the dark.

Ken: Oh get a grip woman, nothing's going to happen, and even if it did, these nice people would warn us, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? You see there's nothing to worry about at all.

{they all switch off their lights}

Bearass: Observe how the Blue John gives off a marvellous glow

Dorothy: Stop it Ken, not here!

Ken: Eh... I didn't do anything.

Dorothy: Well something just brushed against my leg!

Ken: It'll be that Spaniard, I told you they can't be trusted, now look here sonny-Jim, you keep away from my wife or I'll a give you a proper dealing with, I spent 3 years in the Boy's Brigade!

Bearass: Madam, please don't spray perfume in here, it can damage the rock formations...

Ken: Oooooh, you're right, it smells like a cat's been turned inside out... in our downstairs loo.

Dorothy: I didn't spray anything... {sniffs} oh, It smells like Febreze! {lights back on, two Damebots have appeared behind them at the back of the stage looking "warlike"}

Bearass: Well, I don't see anyone else here... can you?

Ken: I can't see anyone?

Dorothy: No, I can't see anyone her either?

{audience participation - behind you etc}

Bearass: Oh, we seem to have some latecomers. Could I see your tickets please?

Damebots: We do not need tickets. We are the Damebots. We will annihalate those who demand to see tickets. {there is a flash and Bearass is thrown to the ground by a force which came from the Damebots. The Dames walk on}

Ken: Dorothy, it's blokes dressed as women

Dorothy: Ken!! you can't say that sort of thing anymore {to one of the Dames} I'm sorry love, he's a bit behind the times.

D1: Silence! We are not men, we are The Dames, and we are now in control of this eyeshadow production facility.

D2: You will begin mining immediately {they give Ken and Dorothy small tools}

Ken: What are these??? These won't work. They don't have the necessary torque to deal with stone this dense. I should know, I was in charge of the Channel Tunnel project. Allow me to educate you about the geological manifestation of this particular area, you see...

D3: Silence! You will begin digging

Ken: I can't do digging, It's my back you see... I've got a blue badge!

Dorothy: Oh be quiet Ken... He only got it so he could park nearer the library.

D4: This is your final warning. You will do as we command, or... {points at a convulsing Bearass who is still on the floor}

Dorothy: I think we should do what they say Ken, look what they did to that lovely Bearass.

Ken: Oooooh 'eck!

{lights out curtains close}

Courtney: Welcome aboard this scheduled flight to the remote space outpost Flash {ahhhhhh, everyone looks to see where that's coming from}. Before we take off I need you to pay attention to this short safety briefing. Your seatbelts are fastened like this {demonstrates}. In the unlikely event that we land on water your lifejackets are {opens a crate it's empty except for a rubber chicken} oh... Well the emergency exits are... erm... I'm not actually sure, just go back the way you came in I suppose. In a few moments we'll begin the onboard refreshment service, in the meantime, please sit back and enjoy your.. {OWBB Interrupts}

OWBB: Never mind all that Courtney, time is of the essence, we need to take off, the future of the galaxy is at stake.

Courtney: Right'o {sound of engine starting, clunky gear changes, bad takeoff, everyone thrown left and right}

Suey: This is amazing, what is it?

OWBB: This is a top-of-the-range Skoda Hyperspeed XL Star Gobbler. We call her the Minelium Falco... The Melamine Falc no, The Magnolia no, The Lemoniee, Minel.... Oh... we call her Betsy.

Suey: Wow!

Courtney: It's got a state-of-the-art, on-board computer system, which has the latest AI voice recognition capabilities. We call her Alexa. {shouting up at the roof} Alexa, Engage Hyperdrive Autopilot.

Alexa: Playing songs by Engelbert Humperdink...

{Engelbert Humperdink song starts playing, everyone looks confused}

OWBB: Alexa, stop! She has great trouble with his accent you see. Alexa, Engage Hyperdrive Autopilot.

Alexa: I'm sorry Hyperdrive Autopilot is not available without Prime membership. Would you like me to email details of the subscription rates.

OWBB: What, no, oh for goodness sake... Courtney you'll just have to fly us through the Wincle Belt manually. Hold on, this could get bumpy!

Courtney: Right'o, here we go...

OWBB: Careful Courtney, {pointing at the audience, before shouting} Asteroids! {audience throw asteroids at the stage, the actors duck out of the way as best they can} Some of them are getting through - shut the window Courtney.

Courtney: I can't the handle's broken!

Alexa: Impact detected... front shields 50%, direct hit to engine bay 3... downstairs toilet no longer operational.

{Courtney is desperately trying to steer through the asteroids with one hand whilst trying to take a selfie with the other}

OWBB: This is not the time for Instagram Courtney, focus on flying!

Courtney: {once the asteroids have run out} I can see Flash {ahhhhhh}

OWBB: There's a clearing down there Courtney, try to land in there...

{Courtney desperately tries to land, but again there is a crashing sound, lights flash, bits of the interior fall off (boxes thrown on stage), the craft skids to a halt and the lights go out}

OWBB: {in the darkness} Is everyone alright?

Suey: I think so

Courtney: This is your captain speaking, thank you for flying with us today, we hope you have a very pleasant holiday and look forward to seeing you all again for the journey home.

{Curtains close}

Pete: Oh, hello, you're new here, there hasn't been another inmate on the prison planet Farton for, oh, as long as I've been here. Nice to have a bit of company. What's your name.

Layabout: Denise

Pete: Oh, lovely to meet you Denise. I'm P.

Layabout: Look, I don't want to seem rude, but I'm just not interested in yer small-talk. If it's all the same to you, I'd rather you just kept yourself to yourself.

Pete: Oh, I see, well do you at least mind me asking what you're in for? I mean, I think I at least deserve to know if I've been locked up with a mass murderer... or worse!

Layabout: {sighs} well if you really must know I was sent here by The Dames from their awful planet, just because they hate me, even though I've done nothing wrong.

Pete: Oh my stars, I don't believe it, we've got loads in common. I was sent here by the Dames too. I was leading a peaceful protest against the horrendous way they're destroying our environment, using up all the natural resources for their pointless cosmetics... So I started a movement. You must have heard of us? {hands her a leaflet} Just Stop Dames! That's me there on the front of the leaflet. So anyway, I'm leading the protest march... I mean I say leading, but there was only me there, but from little acorns etc etc... Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, I'm peacefully protesting, as is my right, and these two nasty little robot things came out, arrested me. I had no legal representation, which is a breach of my human rights, and next thing I know, I'm here, on the planet stench, on my own... until you turned up that is!

Layabout: Mmmmm, what a fascinating story!

Pete: I know. Anyway, you can help me, I'm digging a tunnel {shows her a teaspoon} with this. We're going to escape. Then you can join Just Stop Dames and help in the fight against tyrrany...

Layabout: Look, I'm sorry, but it all sounds like a lot of effort, and I'll be honest, I don't mind it here. I get me food dispensed out of that little hatch in the corner, I can do what I like without anyone bossing me about - I like it.

Pete: But what about the future of our Galaxy. They're destroying planets, they're leading us into an environmental catastrophe. What will we tell future generations?

Layabout: Tell em to stop moping about and whinging!

Pete: We need to go back to The Planet Of The Dames

Layabout: Why go to something, when you can make it come to you... {she closes her eyes, there is a strange noise and her copy of Onsie Weekly "floats through the air" into her hand}

Pete: What on... how did you do that...

Layabout: Can't everyone do that?

Pete: What? No... oh my... you must be a... Jedi!!!!

Layabout: What's a Jedi?

Pete: What's a Jedi???? What's a J... You don't know about the Jedi. Let me tell you about the Jedi, I'm a massive fan. See him {points at a poster of OWBB looking heroic}, on the wall up there, he's my favourite. Oh now that I know you're a Jedi, you HAVE to help dig us out

Layabout: Why bother digging when you could just blow a hole in the wall... with your mind?

Pete: What??? You could do that? Oh my goodness, I'm so excited, we're getting out of here, go on, blow a hole in the wall with your mind.

Layabout: No, yer alright! {she goes back to reading Onesie Weekly, Pete stares at the audience in disbelief, then eventually goes back to digging with his teaspoon, lights go down, curtains close}

Dorothy: Oh Ken, I can't take much more of this, I'm exhausted.

Ken: What can we do Dorothy, what can we do???

Dorothy: I'm going to check on Mr Bearass... see if he's alright... you keep an eye out for those Dame ladies {she moves over to Bearass} Mr Bearass, are you alright, they gave you an awful shock, I don't know what we should do

Bearass: Dorothy, we need to disable those Damebots, they're clearly some kind of cybernetic war machines. We need to create a massive electro-magnetic-pulse to destroy their microprocessors.

Dorothy: Oh, I don't know anything about all that computer stuff. Ken's got a laptop, but he mainly uses it for complaining to the council.

Bearass: {whispering} Dorothy, I have a compass on my toolbelt, that has a weak magnetic force, but if we could find something to amplify that force, well, we may just stand a chance of making a Wasbinator.

Dorothy: Oh, I think you're talking to the wrong person, it's Ken that usually deals with all this, I tend to look after the gardening and whatnot. Wait a minute... did you say amplify? Well Ken's got a hearing aid. Is that a kind of amplifier?

Bearass: You're a genius Dorothy, that might just work.

Dorothy: Ken, Ken, {whispering} we need your hearing aid.

Ken: What?

Dorothy: {slightly louder} we need your hearing aid

Ken : Speak up woman, I can't hear a word you're saying.

Dorothy: {right next to him, shouting} WE NEED YOUR HEARING AID

Ken: {rocks back in shock at the loud noise} There's no need to shout Dorothy!!! {he takes his hearing aid out, passes it to Dorothy, who passes it to Bearass}

Bearass: OK, snip that wire there, join that to my compass here, wrap the whole thing in a bit of tinfoil from my sandwich box... there, it won't win any design awards, but it might just do the trick. Dorothy, I need you to attract the Damebots within range, then we can try deploying The Wasbinator

Dorothy: Me and Ken could sing a song, Ken was in a group in the 60's

Ken: We were called The Hinges!

Dorothy: They supported The Doors!

SONG>Space Oddity

{During the song Dorothy signals to Bearass who turns on the Wasbinator, there is a crackling noise and a flash. The Damebots fall to the ground convulsing, then are still}

Ken: By eck lad, you did it, I've got to say, I think I may have underestimated you, well done son.

Bearass: Thank you Ken, but I couldn't have done it without Dorothy here.

Ken: What's that, speak up lad, I can't hear a word you're saying.

Dorothy: Come on Ken we need to get out before The Dames come back.

Bearass: Don't worry, I know these caves like the back of my hand, we need to head due south from here. We'll be out of here in no time. Let me just check my compass... Oh... {looks at his compass which is completely destroyed} That's not good.

{one of the Damebots starts to shakily move its arm, then begins to sit up, they have clearly not been destroyed. The other Damebot starts recovering and they both get to their feet. The curtains close}

> Act 2 Scene 1

[The interior of the petrol station at Flash Star Stores]

Suey: Why are we here Mr Bogie?

OWBB: We need to know the whereabouts of your sibling Mr Suey. Many strange people pass through this place, gossip will be exchanged, information traded. The owner of this establishment has often been of assistance to me... But be careful, not everyone here is to be trusted. You can run into all sorts of characters.

Suey: Sounds like a night at the WI - I don't go meself obviously, but our Calamity does, and the tales she tells me.

OWBB: {annoyed} I very much doubt her "WI" has anything like the sort of low-life vagabonds who frequent this place.

Suey: Oh, you'd be surprised, there's a woman who sits at the back and she...

OWBB: Be discreet Mr Suey, stay quiet, let me do the talking, and try not to make eye contact. {a 6-eyed alien walks in and stares at Suey, he tries to look away but it keeps staring at him}. Ah... there she is... {a pink space octopus is busy serving customers. She has an Italian accent. Amongst others, the Big Gulp Bunny is standing in the queue, holding a bunch of carrots and looking impatient.}

Debra: which-a pump-a number you-a been-a to-a my friend-a? {alien mumble}... Numero 5-a, OK, 60000 intastellas... {alien outburst}. Whaddayamean its a twice the price as last time... you know issa difficult to get space-diesel these days? {alien pulls gun, Debra snatches it from him and waves it in his face, grabs his debit card and taps it to pay, then throws it back and shoots a warning shot past the alien's feet}, maybe you go-a somewhere else-a next-a time eh? {alien runs out screaming. Debra spots OBWBB}. Well-a, if it isnt my old-a friend-a, Da Bigga Da Bogie. How you been mi amore? {whispers} It's a been a long-a time-a since we... you know... {winks (if a space octopus can wink!)}.

OWBB: Good to see you Debra, you still seem to have a way with your customers.

Debra: They drive-a me crazy, but for you... I make a special deal, {waves a bar of chocolate at him}, issa on da house... which pump-a you use?

[Alternative] Debra: They-a drive-a me crazy, but you, we have a speciale relationship no? {whispering} Whadda-you need? Guns? Drugs?... Girls? Confectionary????!? {she waves a Mars bar at him provocatively}

OWBB: No Debra, we're not here for Mars bars.

Debra: Ahhh, maybe this-a strapping young lad is here for a job eh? I could do with an extra pair of hands...Ha ha ha.

OWBB: No Debra... we're here for information.

Debra: Informatzionio eh? You hear that {gesturing at other customers}, he needs-a da gossip... Well, issa still gonna cost-ya Bogie Man... one way or another {winks again}.

OWBB: We're interested in the whereabouts of {whispers....}

Debra: Ooooh, royalty eh? And Jedi royalty too! Issa gonna cost extra.

OWBB: Do you know where we can find this individual?

Debra: Mmmm, I notta hear anything from the, how you say, USUAL SOURCES (Suspects?), but you 'ave a browse o da pick-and-a-mix-a, and I'll put some feelers out, ha ha ha... No, seriously, I make a few enquiries eh?

OWBB: Time is of the essence Debra, the fate of a planet is at stake.

Debra: {slightly annoyed} Eh, maybe you think I gotta nothing betta to do-a. Eh, look at me... my hands are full. Maybe you need to learn a little patience eh?

OWBB: Come Mr Suey, to the Pick-and-mix.
{Suey and OWBB move across to an impressive looking pick-n-mix stand}

Suey: Well, she seems nice. Did, er you and her... you know?

OWBB: Sometimes it is necessary to make great sacrifices in order to keep the universe in balance, so yes, there was a time when we... we held hands.

Suey: How did you know which one to...

Dan Lothario: Excuse me, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation with the, er, "thing", over there. It sounds very much like I may be able to help you. Allow me to introduce myself... I am Captain Dan Lothario, legend of the stars, defender of the weak, greatly appreciated by the ladies, Ding Dong, Fwah! I think you may be looking for {whispers} and I happen to know their whereabouts. They are currently incarcerated on the prison planet Farton, a place I'm afraid I spent a brief spell myself, over a ridiculous misunderstanding with a short-tempered wine merchant.. and his good lady wife...

OWBB: Can you take us there?

Dan Lothario: Well, my Space Jag is parked outside, but she's a bit of an eyecatcher, might attract too much attention... especially female attention if you know what I mean, wooof!

Courtney: {enters, covered in oil and dirt} It's no use, I can't fix it, the engine won't start, the stereo's only playing Radio 4, and the toilet's completely...

Dan Lothario: {interrupting} it would appear that you have two problems old chap. You require a guide to take you to Farton, AND you need someone, {looking at Courtney and rolling his eyes} who knows what they're doing, to repair your spacecraft. Allow me to introduce my companion. {WD40 rolls on stage} This is WD40. He can repair any kind of mechanical problem you may have, he can lubricate gears and chains... and he's quite good at getting stains out of expensive upholstery.

WD40: Your engine has been thrashed... what kind of incompetent {bleep} has been flying that clapped out piece of {bleeeep}? {Courtney looks downcast}

Dan Lothario: Ha, forgive WD40's bedside manner, he's not very good at the whole social chit chat thing, likes to speak his mind... but he will be able to fix your problem and then we can all blow off to Farton, so to speak... As long as our terms are acceptable?

OWBB: You will receive everything you deserve, do not worry about that. But your little droid must get to work immediately, I can feel a worrying disturbance in The Force.

Courtney: It's probably that milk you had on your Shreddies, I told you the Falcon's fridge wasn't working properly... it smelt minging!

WD40: {as they all leave stage} who is he calling a "little droid", these humans are so rude, I'll {bleeeping} {bleep} his head so far up his {bleeping} {bleeep} that he'll think he's fallen into a black hole!

{Ken has been stripped to his underwear and is tied up ready to be tortured}

Ken: Don't think you can intimidate me with your threats. You don't scare me, I used to fly submarines... in the war.

Damebot: You must be punished for your insurrection

Ken: {Looking down at his crotch} I don't know what you're talking about... Oh, you mean our little rebellion, well this is hardly the way to treat a captured enemey combatant (prisoner of war). It's against the Geneva Convention.

Damebot: You will be tortured until you tell us everything you know.

Ken: Tell you everything I know. Ha, I've forgotten more than you'll ever learn you cheeky young whippersnappers. You might think you're clever with your cybernetic techno-malarky, but I spent 5 years at NASA... designing the teasmaid for the Apollo 11 mission... and they went to the moon with that! Buzz Aldrin said that was the best cup of PG Tips he'd ever had, smashing fella was Buzz.

Damebot: All hail The Dames

{Dames enter - one has a beard... One drinking a can of Stella. Another is scratching their arse.}

Ken: Oooooh 'eck they're starting to look quite tough!

D3: What time does the footie kick off?

D4: BURP!!!!

D1: So, you think you can outwit The Dames with your silly little Wasbinator do you?

D2: You cannot defeat the mighty Dame species, we are invincible.

D3: But we need to know how you created such a large power surge. We will steal this technology and become even more invincible.

Ken: strictly speaking, I don't think you can become MORE invincible. You see it's from the Latin, invincibilis which means... {he is interrupted}

D1: Quiet. You will explain your amplification system.

D2: Or we will MAKE you

Bearass {from off stage} Don't tell him Ken, if they get their hands on the Wasbinator, then heaven help us.

Dorothy: {from off stage} oh, please don't torture him... he's got athlete's foot

Ken: don't worry Dorothy, they won't break me, {to the Dames} I was in 'Nam you know. I saw things in 'Nam that I wouldn't wish on anyone.

Dorothy: You were in Chelt'nam Ken, he worked on the checkout (stacked shelves) at Kwiksave.

D1: Begin... the dissing...

Ken: The... what... oh, no, no, not that, anything but that!

D2: Look at his legs, I've seen bigger drumsticks in the freezer section on the planet Aldi.

Ken: Aaaaaghhhh... no stop it, please.

D3: Go on Florence, throw some shade, diss him some more.

Ken: No, please, I can't take it...

D2: Look at his nose, you could dig for truffles with that!

Ken: Aaaaaghhhh!

D3: Hey girls, it wouldn't cost much to send that package

Ken: Aaaaaghhhh!

Damebot: {enters stage carrying a container of blue eyeshadow} The digging has been a success. The first batch is prepared.

D1: {grabbing the container} Give me some of that, where's the mirror {strides purposefully off stage, sounds of her smearing it over her eyes, werewolf-type transformation SFX, maybe bright blue light flickers from offstage, she returns wearing a huge blue wig... she has become a super Dame}. I've never felt so feminine, I have become... Super Dame!

{the other Dames all run offstage, shouting, give me some of that eyeshadow, I'm first etc as D1 stands triumphant and Ken looks terrified}

D1: As Super Dames, conquering one planet is just the beginning, we shall take the whole universe!

Ken: Ohhhhh eck!!!

[Prison cell on Farton]

Layabout: I really don't know why you're bothering, even if you manage to tunnel through the wall, there's nothing out there, and it stinks. You'd just be outside in the smelly emptiness.

P: We HAVE to do something, or what will we tell future generations?

Layabout: tell em to calm down and stop being so annoying

P: Shhhh... I think I can hear something...

{We hear muffled voices, there's a crumbling noise and the sound of Suey shouting "we're nearly through"... and the tunnel is completed. Suey emerges.. Prisoner is delighted}

P: Who on earth are you.

Suey: I'm Mr Suey, you must be my brother... the other Jedi?

P: I wish I was, I'm a massive fan of the Jed-I don't believe it... {as OWBB enters, he points at his poster} It's you!

OWBB: goodness, that's a very old picture. Mr Suey, allow me to introduce you to your... Sister... Princess Layabout.

Suey: Oh wow, I've got a sister, hiya...

Layabout: {totally uninterested} Yeah, what-ever... I doubt we'll get on, you're nothing like me.

{Then DL comes through the tunnel complaining that his suit is covered in dust}.

Dan Lothario: This place hasn't changed a bit, still smelly and dusty and... oh hello... {spotting Layabout} who's this? You weren't here last time... nice onesie!

Layabout: {Clearly in lurve at first sight} Oh.....

{P is asking OWBB for his autograph}

P: if you could just put "To my best mate...", and then I'll spell my name out cos it's quite complicated, it's P...

OWBB: {interrupting} I'll just put "All The Best, Obi-Wan Big Bogie"

P: Oh {disappointed}, can I have a selfie?

OWBB: No! {to Jedis} Your potential is great, but you have much to learn. I shall teach you all that I know. {P is trying to take selfies and becoming annoying}. Sorry, I don't know your name...

P: Oh the name's P..

OWBB: {Interrupting} I don't NEED to know your name, I NEED to train these young apprentices in the ways of the Jedi, so if you don't mind... {P looks very sad, gets sympathy from the audience, OWBB has banter with them "oh don't encourage him etc" until he relents}. Very well, why don't you go outside and bring my Jedi equipment bag... it's in the boot... of the spacecraft...

P: Oh, thank you Mr Big Bogie, it would be an honour Mr Big Bogie... {P leaves}

{Layabout and DL are on one side of the stage flirting, whilst Suey is tries to get her attention, but she keeps pushing him away and trying to ignore him. He begins complaining to the audience}

Suey: I can't believe this, I've come half way across the universe in a battered old spaceship, I've drilled through this prison wall, I've found a long lost sister I never knew I had, and she doesn't even want to talk to me... {looks sad, ahhhh, I'm sadder than that!}

P: {returns with light sabres in duffel bag} I've got them Mr Bogie, just like you asked... Why does your spaceship smell of dog poo...

OWBB: Well come on man, get on with it {P attempts to inflate the first light sabre without success, repeats with the second, before DL steps in and inflates both with ease, impressing Layabout even more}.

Layabout: What's that for???

DL: My darling, I have travelled across galaxies with these people and I know that their quest is true, and that they need your help. You're the most wonderful woman I've met this week, and I know you are capable of great deeds.

[Starship Trooper]

Layabout: But I don't know how to fight...

OWBB: Allow me to share with both of you the experience of a thousand Jedi warriors...

{Montage, Light sabres, running on the spot, star jumps, OWBB has a stopwatch, and a clipboard, YO-YOs, blindfolds, drop tennis balls on string from above etc etc}

OWBB: I have taught you everything I know.

Suey: That was quick

OWBB: We must now plan our mission - The Dames have invaded Earth in order to meet their insatiable desire for blue eyeshadow. They are large in number, and in size, so we must find their achilles heel, some weakness which will help us

Layabout: Strictly Come Dancing

Everyone: Sorry... What???

Layabout: Strictly Come Dancing, they're mad for it. As soon as it comes on they're in a different world, you can't get a word out of them... that's their achilles heel!

{Ken, Dorothy and Bearass are hard at work, as the Damebots monitor them with their backs to the audience. The Jedis creep down the aisle, light-sabres at the ready}

OWBB: Now, remember your training my young Jedi. Move quickly, but silently, feel the force coursing through your veins, channel that energy like hundreds of your kind have done before...

Suey: and then whack 'em with our light-sabres?

OWBB: {disappointed that his young apprentice doesn't share his love for the poetic...} Yes, yes... whack them with your light-sabres.

Suey and Layabout: MINT, Let's get em!

{The Damebots are alerted by the outburst and turn to face the Jedi. A battle ensues, with lots of banter between Suey and Layabout, high fiving as they help each other out. Do Ken, Dot and BA scuttle off stage? Eventually the Damebots are defeated. The Dames enter, all wearing blue "superdame" wigs.}

D1: Well well well, what do we have here? If it isn't the last of the Jedi, led by

D2: And who's this, he looks like Iron Man!

D3: That's good, I've got a pile of bloomers {holding up a big basket of brightly coloured knickers} that needs ironing!

D4: Ooooh, he'll definitely need The Force to get through them. {The Dames all laugh at Suey}

D1: And you {pointing at Layabout}, aren't you supposed to be in prison?

D2: I wouldn't rely on this one, she's so lazy that ????

D3: Yeah, she's lazier than a ????

D4: Yeah ????

Layabout: I've changed, I've met people who believe in me, a family, and friends, who... Love Me!

Dames: {Mocking} Ooooooh... they LOOOOOVE Me!

D1: Well you're no match for our Damely one-liners. Get her D2

D2:

OWBB: This is no good, our Jedi powers are strong, but we cannot compete with Panto-Power. {shouting down the aisle} Courtney... we must play our trump card. {Loud fart sound, OWBB looks exasperated} No Courtney... unleash the secret weapon. {Courtney has a massive ghetto-blaster on his shoulder, and presses Play. The Strictly theme tune blasts out, and The Dames are all suddenly distracted}

D1: {looking down the aisle} Is that Anton Du Beke?

D2: Ooooh Strictly

{they all become entranced}
{Ken and Dorothy waltz on and do a dance? Dames shout encouragement/critique, discuss the merits of the dance between themselves? At the end they all shout SEVEN! Maybe they one by one say their bit like the judges on Strictly?}

Dorothy: I don't understand what all this trouble was in aid of.

D1: We need Blue Eyeshadow, to keep us looking feminine.

Dorothy: But Blue Eyeshadow is SO last century. I'm a Tik Tok influencer, all the youngsters follow me, I've got my finger on the pulse of the make-up world, and I've got to tell you... It's all about orange these days!

D2: Orange?

D3: What's orange?

D4: Orange?

D1: We don't understand, what is this Orange of which you speak?

Dorothy: I've got some here. It's completely organic, environmentally friendly, non-hypo-allergenic, easy to find on ALL the fashionable planets and... best of all... {dabbing it onto the Dames} It looks fabulous!

D1: Ooooh, that feels lovely. Very calming.

D2: Oooh, I see what you mean, I feel womanly, but without the catty-ness!

D3: Oh, I agree. I feel very chilled out!

D4: Does anyone fancy a bit of yoga?

Dorothy: You see... it's all natural and MUCH better for your mental health. You can find the recipe on my Instagram page.

D1: Oh, Dorothy, we're so sorry for all that "We are The Dames" nonsense.

D2: I suppose we were all just a bit stressed?

D3: Yes, sorry for torturing you Ken, it was nothing personal.

D4: Does anyone else have a craving for tofu?

Dorothy: {unties the dames} well, no real harm done, I think Ken's a bit traumatised, but he's had worse.

Ken: Oh, I'm fine, it'll take more than a few fat blokes in dresses to bother me. I ??????.

D1: Well, we'd better get back home, come along ladies.

Dames: {bye Dorothy, nice to meet you}

OWBB: Dorothy, the Force is strong within you. Have you ever considered becoming a Jedi.

Dorothy: Oh goodness no, I've got more than enough on my plate what with YouTube and TikTok and Instagram, and Ken. Come on Ken, I think we'd better get home before you get into any more scrapes. {K&D say their farewells and exit}.

Suey: Well I should be getting back home. Calamity will be worried sick... Can I get a lift back Courtney?

Courtney: Err, yeah, no problem, if you're not afraid of my driving?

Suey: No, I think you did a great job getting us here. I believe in you.

OWBB: Come on then Mr Suey, let's get you back

Suey: {noticing that Layabout is looking sad in the corner} Eh, sis, are you coming?

Layabout: What? You want me to come back with you?

Suey: Well yeah. I've never had a sister before, and now I have, well, that's great innit?. Come on, you need to meet Calamity, she's a bit of an acquired taste like but, you know, that's families for ya!

Layabout: I LOVE Coke

Suey: Really??? I LOVE Coke. How about some Dippers Fried Chicken?

Layabout: I LOVE fried chicken!

Suey: I LOVE fried chicken! What about a curly wurly?

Layabout: Whats a curly wurly? {Suey gives her a bit of chocolate, she tries it} I LOVE curly wurly?

Suey: Oh this is great, we've got so much in common apart from all the Jedi stuff of course. Just a minute {shouts offstage towards "Calamity"} Calam, you're never gonna believe it... I've been into space. I've met a pink octopus. I've trained as a Jedi warrior, we've defeated an army of Dames, and saved the galaxy. Oh, and I've got a sister.

Calamity: Suey, is that you? What time do you call this. Did you take the trash out. Have you fed the cats? Did you get my blue eyeshadow?

## Tragedy

Here we are, in a lost and lonely galaxy
Sisterhood, destroyed by her duplicity
Layabout, she's guilty that's beyond all doubt
And it's really got us feeling blue, feeling blue
What do we do?

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs are not enough and we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, our stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

Now she's gone, we need some kind of strategy
A masterplan, to save us from this misery
We're superdames, we only need to use our brains
To show the world that we are queens, we are queens, in ultramarine
We are supreme!

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs are not enough and we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, our stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

Dorothy to husband Ken

Ground Control to Major Tom
Dorothy to husband Ken

Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Take your back-pain pills and put your cardi on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Husband Ken to Dorothy

Commencing countdown, engines on
I think I may have sprained 'me knee

Check ignition and may God's love be with you
'mi shoulder's stiffnin' up and I really need a wee

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
This is Dot and Ken to anyone...

You've really made the grade
We think we've been enslaved

And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
And we wish we'd spent our weekend break elsewhere

Now it's time to leave the capsule, if you dare
Now it's time to leave this cavern if we dare

This is Major Tom to Ground Control
This is Dorothy to Cave Patrol

I'm stepping through the door
It's time to do your thi-i-i-ing

And I'm floating in a most peculiar way

And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in a tin can
For here we are singing in the darkness

Far above the world
Far below the world

Planet Earth is blue
This old cavern's blue

And there's nothing I can do
And we don't know what to do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
Though we've asked one hundred thousand times

I'm feeling very still
They wouldn't let us rest

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
And I think our tour-guide knows which way to go

Tell my man I love him very much, he knows
Tell my wife I love her very much, I know

Ground Control to Major Tom
Dorothy to husband Ken

Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Your hearing's dead, so I'll ask again

Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you-
Can you-

For here am I sitting in a tin can
For here we are singing in the darkness

Far above the world
Far below the world

Planet Earth is blue
This old cavern's blue

And there's nothing I can do
And we don't know what to do
