## Act 1 Scene 1

[On the Planet of the Dames]

_Damebots march up aisle and then FOC "We are the Dame-Bots"_

**Dan Lothario:** _rummaging through a suitcase full of black-market stuff, pauses for a moment as he realises he's not alone, sees audience, slams case shut_ I say, you frightened the life out of me. Which planet did you all come from? _maybe audience participation/banter Earth??? Never heard of it etc? Then re-opens the suitcase_. Perhaps I could interest you in some bottles of gin I've, erm, "managed to acquire". No, maybe some disposable vapes, I've got watermelon or rhubarb and beef. No, how about some genuine fake Rolex watches? No? Ah well, suit yourselves. Oh, where ARE my manners, allow me to introduce my very good self. I am Captain Dan Lothario, I'm an intergalactic business man, I deal in a bit of this, a bit of that... a bit of the other, if you understand my meaning ladies? Woof! Oh yes, I'm very well respected across many of the most sophisticated planets around here. I've been to, oh, what's the one with the rings round it? That's right, Suttern. And that poxy little one down there... Macc-ury. Oh, and I've just come back from Uranus. I'm here to sell some of my extra special cosmetics to some exquisite ladies... Oh... here they come... wish me luck... Showtime!!! _he clicks his fingers, freezes and the lights switch to 2 Dames who enter, loudly bantering with each other, arguing over which is the most beautiful_

**Florence:** Look, I'm not being funny...

**Beatrice:** No change there then!!!

**Florence:** ...I'm NOT BEING FUNNY, but it's obvious that I'm the prettiest Dame on this planet.

**Beatrice:** I think you'll find that I'm FAR prettier than you, all the men round here agree.

**Florence:** Men? What men? There ARE no men on this planet... just us ladies... _simpers, flutters eyelashes etc_

**Beatrice:** Well then what's HE doing here _points to Dan Lothario, who immediately unfreezes_

**Florence:** Oh my goodness... it's a man, and a pretty good looking one at that. Where did he come from?

**Beatrice:** Never mind where he came from, he's mine, I'll seduce him with my womanly ways...

**Florence:** No, no, no, no, no, that's NOT what's going to happen. I saw him first, he's mine. And besides, as I was just pointing out, I'M the prettiest Dame on this planet. I took first place at the Alpha Centurai beauty contest.

**Beatrice:** That wasn't a beauty contest, it was an agriculture show. _To the audience_ She won the Aberdeen Angus category!

_cue slapping and arguing_

**Florence:** Well, there's only one way to settle this...

**Beatrice:** You don't mean

**Florence:** Yes... we've got ourselves a Flirt-off! _Cue flirting, simpering, crotch-thrusting, whatever... towards Dan Lothario who snaps back to life_

**Dan Lothario:** _once the flirting has finished_ My my, aren't you the most enchanting maidens I've had the good fortune to lay my eyes upon?
_giggling from Dames, followed by violent agreement over how beautiful they both are, but then turning into argument over who is MOST beautiful. Florence decides to take the initiative..._

**Florence:** I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

**Dan Lothario:** _to the audience_ That doesn't surprise me.

**Beatrice:** _pushing Florence out of the way_ But I'd LIKE to!

**Florence:** _pushing Beatrice back out of the way_ Allow me to interrogate myself with yourself. I'm Florence and, as well as being the prettiest Dame on this planet, I'm also in charge of things.

**Beatrice:** Woah, woah, woah there droopy drawers, i'm Beatrice, I'M in charge, and _looking pointedly at Florence_ I'm the prettiest.

**Dan Lothario:** Well, I'm Captain Dan Lothario, and it's an absolute delight to meet you both. And may I say you both look absolutely smashing in your outfits, they certainly, flatter your, "ample figures". I honestly don't think I could choose between either of you _grimaces at audience_.

_More simpering from Dames_

**Dan Lothario:** But hold on... _sniffs the air around them_ What IS that smell? _Dames sniff their own armpits, each other etc_

**Beatrice:** _puzzled_ I can't smell 'owt

**Florence:** Me neither.

**Dan Lothario:** Well THAT'S the problem. Two fabulous looking ladies like yourselves deserve a certain "Je ne sais quoi"

**Florence:** A Gin and say whatsit?

**Beatrice:** Ohhh, I like the sound of that, 2 pints of Gin and a packet of cheesy Wotsits please!

**Dan Lothario:** _spelling it out for them_ Je... Ne... Sais... Quoi...

**Florence:** _to Beatrice_ I think it's German

**Beatrice:** _to Florence_ Which planet's that?

**Dan Lothario:** You need an eau-de-toillette.

**Florence:** No thanks! _proudly_ I went before I came on stage.

**Beatrice:** She did... _to the audience, screwing up her face_ I heard!

**Dan Lothario:** _becoming exasperated_ Oh good lord, have you not heard of cologne?

**Florence:** Oh that's definitely in Germany

**Beatrice:** Oooooh, you're SO good on geology!

**Dan Lothario:** May I enquire where do you fine ladies purchase "olfactory delights"?

**Florence:** _looking puzzled - no idea what olfactory means, but guesses it might be something to do with offal_ Well, Ethel down the street runs the butchers, if that's what you mean?

**Dan Lothario:** I mean who satisfies your perfumery requirements.

**Beatrice:** _to Florence_ He's making no scents!

**Florence:** _to the audience_... making no scents!!! Get it... scents... no? Oh, you're in for a long night!

**Dan Lothario:** well this is your lucky day ladies. Amongst other things, I happen to be the exclusive representative for one of the most sought after perfume brands in the universe. Just a small spray of my product will have the gentlemen... flocking round.

**Beatrice:** _to Florence, looking a little concerned that he may have heard something rude_ what did he say Florence?

**Florence:** Flocking Beatrice... flocking!

**Dan Lothario:** Now this IS extremely exclusive, so it's rather pricey... but you seem like the kind of classy ladies who don't worry about that sort of thing.

**Florence:** _putting on posh voices_ Oh no, we're very upmarket... I once knew someone from the Wilmslow galaxy.

**Beatrice:** _trying to be even posher_ And I've been to Leek.

**Florence:** _looking down at Beatrice's feet_ what, just now???! Could you not have waited until the end of this scene? _realising her mistake_ Oh, I see, Leek, sorry.

**Dan Lothario:** Allow me to introduce you to Faybrehze pour Femme. _takes out a large squirty bottle labelled Febreeze and proceeds to squirt them both. They're both taken aback, don't seem to appreciate the smell, and start imploring him to stop. He takes another sniff in their general direction_. Oh, MUCH better, my I'm getting URGES just inhaling your aroma.

**Florence:** Well let those urges spring forth Danny Boy, let em out.

**Dan Lothario:** If I wasn't such a gentleman...

**Beatrice:** Well WE won't tell anyone, will we Florence?

**Dan Lothario:** Sadly I have other appointments in the Langley Constellation, and you know how stylish the ladies are there. I'd hate them to have all of this Faybreaze to themselves... shall I put you down for, say... 23 gallons?

**Florence:** _to Beatrice_ do you think that'll be enough?

**Beatrice:** make it 25 gallons and give us a couple of bottles of that "Ginney Says Quaz" stuff you drink.

**Dan Lothario:** excellent, it's cash only, I'm afraid _handing them an invoice. They both look shocked, and splutter about it being a bit steep etc, but then, aware that they've made out how posh they are, scrape around in their pockets and manage to pull together the requisite cash, which they hand over, slightly reluctantly_. A pleasure doing business with you absolute babes. Au revoir, as they say... _shrugging at the audience_ in Germany. _he exits_

**Florence:** Well, he was a bit of alright

**Beatrice:** What a charmer. He definitely fancied ME.

_More Dames enter loudly, some only partially made up, arguing_

**Jackie:** Cultured... you??? I've seen more culture in a tub of yogurt!

**Gertrude:** How dare you, I was in the ballet.

**Jackie:** Which one was it... Swan CAKE???? Ha, ha, ha, eughhhh, what IS that smell... It smells like a badger's exploded

**Gertrude:** It's burning my eyes.

**Florence:** What do you think girls, how do you like our new, perfume?

**Beatrice:** It's called Faybrehhzzzz.

**Jackie:** It stinks

**Gertrude:** It's still burning my eyes

**Florence:** Oh you're just jealous cos we smell divine, and you don't

**Beatrice:** We'll have men falling at our feet

**Jackie:** I wouldn't be at all surprised. You'll poison'em with THEM fumes!

**Gertrude:** Where DID you get that noxious abomination from?

**Florence:** A very tasty gentleman, Captain Dan Lothario sold it to us. I think he quite fancied me.

**Beatrice:** He says the ladies on Langley are mad for this stuff, and you know how cosmopolitan they are!

**Gertrude:** Langley, you say?

**Jackie:** Give us some of that!

**Gertrude:** _eyes screwed shut_ Spray it on my face!!!

**Florence:** _begins to spray, but then notices Gertrude has a 5-o-clock shadow_ Are you starting to grow... A BEARD??? _everyone else gathers round to look and agrees that seems to be the case_

**Gertrude:** Well, YOUR voice seems to be getting a lot deeper!

**Beatrice:** I must admit, I seem to be struggling to keep up with my leg-shaving recently

**Jackie:** Oh, it's YOU who pinched my Black And Decker Strimmer is it? I was wondering why I couldn't find it!

**Beatrice:** Well what's going on? Why are we becoming less...feminine?

**Florence:** Well we all know what keeps us looking gorgeous and ladylike...

**Other Dames (Together):** BLUE EYESHADOW!

**Florence:** Exactly. _shouting offstage_ Igor!!! _a servant shuffles on_. Go to the makeup warehouse and bring us some more blue eyeshadow. _he shuffles off_

**Beatrice:** Good thinking Florence, I've completely run out of it.

**Jackie:** Me too.

**Gertrude:** And me.

**Igor:** _returning_ My Queen, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but there is no blue eyeshadow left. _da da daaaaaa_

**Florence:** I bet SHE's used it all!

**Beatrice:** That Layabout!

**Gertrude:** Oh that's TYPICAL of her!

**Jackie:** Why did we ever agree to take her in when she was a baby?

**Beatrice:** She's nothing but trouble.

**Jackie:** Selfish!

**Gertrude:** And lazy!

**Florence:** Well - this is the final straw, _shouting offstage_ Damebots... bring that Layabout out here.

_the Dames all look angrily at each other. Two Damebots drag Princess Layabout on stage. Dame Jackie takes the towel off her head and replaces it with a badly made judge's wig_

**Jackie:** By the authority vested in me by the sisterhood of Dames, I, Jackie Weaver, declare the opening of this trial.

**Layabout:** You have no authority here Jackie Weaver!

**Jackie:** _hammering a gavel_ Silence in court! Princess Denise Layabout, you stand accused of stealing blue eyeshadow with a market value of 7 million lunabucks. How do you plead?

**Layabout:** Why would I steal yer eyeshadow, I don't need eyeshadow, I don't need ANY makeup. I'm just naturally attractive, unlike you freaks! _gasps of horror from the other Dames_

**Beatrice:** _to the audience_ I hardly need any makeup either, just a little foundation and my blue eyeshadow and I look fabulous

**Layabout:** do me a favour, you've got a cement mixer in your room, you trowel it on!

**Jackie:** _more gavel hammering_ Silence! I call the first witness for the prosecution.

**Florence:** Thankyou m'lady. Calling Gertrude Scuttle. _Gertrude steps forward_ You are Gertrude Matilda Scuttle.

**Gertrude:** I am.

**Florence:** And when did you last see your blue eyeshadow.

**Gertrude:** Well, I left it out on the side just before SHE came in, and when she left... it was GONE! _gasps, tuts etc from Dames_

**Florence:** No further questions your honour

**Jackie:** Any words for the defence _Layabout looks around and realises she has no legal counsel_

**Beatrice:** Get on with it, Strictly's on in ten minutes!!!

**Layabout:** I dunno why yer all so cruel to me, you've never liked me, never paid me any attention, never brought me up proper... you're the worst step-parents a girl could ever have... And you all... LOOK LIKE MEN!!!!

_more gasps of outrage_

**Jackie:** Silence in court! I have heard the evidence and it is most damning. You are a lazy, bad-mannered, insolent young lady. And following this disgraceful crime you appear to show no remorse. I find you guilty in the eyes of this court and sentence you, to life imprisonment... Take her away.

_Damebots march her offstage, she screams abuse back at the Dames, Igor follows her offstage_

**Jackie:** Ooooooh, that felt good didn't it? I felt like a proper judge and everything.

**Florence:** You were very stern Jackie, I loved the "Silence in court" bit.

**Beatrice:** _to Florence_ well your prosecuting skills were very impressive...

**Florence:** D'ya think so? I wasn't sure if it was a bit much...

**Gertrude:** So what do we do with her?

**Florence:** Send her to prison

**Beatrice:** A really horrible prison

**Gertrude:** You don't mean

**Jackie:** Yes, I sentence her to life on the prison planet... Farton

_Other Dames screw up their noses, knowing what Farton smells like_

**Beatrice:** this is all well and good, but without blue shadow, we're all going to turn into men.

SONG: Tragedy

**Florence:** _addressing the Damebots_ Damebots... how do you make blue eyeshadow?

**Damebot 1**: It is made from Derbyshire Spar, commonly known as Blue John

**Beatrice:** Ooooh, Blue John, I'd like to meet him!

**Jackie:** Quiet, Beatrice... Where do we find Blue John?

**Damebot 2**: It is only found in the Blue John Cavern

**Gertrude:** And where's that

**Damebots:** Eaaaarth

**All Dames:** Eaaaaaaarthhhhh?

**Beatrice:** Eugh, that sounds horrible. Right, well, order us some more from Eaaaaarth...

**Damebot 1:** This is impossible. Earth has recently left the Common Galactic Trading Federation and they can no longer export their goods.

_Dames all look at each other in disbelief_

**Florence:** Right then, there's only one thing for it, no one will stand in our way, we will destroy everything in our path. We will... invade Eaaaaaarth! _Big sound effect/music/Darth Vader march_

_Curtains close, Front of Curtain we see Obi Wan Big Bogie and Igor. Obi-Wan Big Bogie is partially shrouded in a hooded cape_

**Obi-Wan:** You have intelligence for me?

**Igor:** _whispers_ Layabout... Eyeshadow... Guilty... Invasion!

**Obi-Wan:** I see. Thank-you Igor, you are a true friend of The Force. It seems The Dames have taken things too far this time. The balance of good and evil is tipping. The time has come to re-unite the Jedi and fulfill the prophecy.

_they bow to each other and both leave through curtain_

## Act 1 Scene 2

[Suey and Calamity's living room]

_Mr Suey is dressed as he was last year but with the addition of a little lacy pinnie. He also has a feather duster and is clearly doing his housework. Calamity is never seen, only heard from offstage_

**Calamity:** Suey, have you finished dusting my nick-nacks?

**Suey:** Nearly love...

**Calamity:** Well you be sure not to miss anything, some of my nick-nacks were filthy after you did it last week. And don't forget to take out the trash.

**Suey:** I won't _he's getting annoyed, then spots the audience_. Calam? Are you expecting visitors?

**Calamity:** _not really paying attention_ What!?!?

**Suey:** Hiya, you must be that lot from last year, I guess you saw me in the panto and liked me so much you wanted more? _bit of banter with audience_ Well some of you must remember me? I was the big hero _he looks down and realises he's wearing his pinnie, which he takes off and throws away hoping no-one has noticed_... I saved the day, can't believe some of you don't know who I am. No... Well I'm Mr Suey, last time some of you were here I was working as a henchman for a really bad fella, but I gave it up for a woman _nods offstage to where Calamity is_. She can be a bit bossy, and she does nag me, and she's always picking fault with what I do, but, you know, I'm the one in charge round here... _he's distracted by a loud screeching and a crash_. What in the name of Ringo Starr was that????

_the sound of voices offstage_

**Obi-Wan:** I keep telling you Courtney, use your wing-mirrors, and signal before making a right turn.

**Courtney:** I did all of that master, but that pigeon came out of nowhere...

**Obi-Wan:** Oh Courtney, I really don't know how I manage to keep my patience with you, go and check if you've damaged anything while I deal with our business here _there's a knock at the door, and Suey goes to answer. OWBB strides in_. Good morning Mr Suey, it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

**Suey:** Eh, what, who are you?

**Obi-Wan:** My name is Obi Wan Big Bogie.

**Suey:** How do you know MY name?

**Obi-Wan** I know everything about you Mr Suey. I know you were found as a baby on the doorstep of a Chinese Takeaway in Birkenhead. You were raised as a Liverpool supporter. Your favourite chocolate bar is the Curly Whirly. You have a squirrel-shaped birthmark on your left but...

**Suey:** OK, OK, I get it you know all about me. I'm just a scouse ex-henchman who's bad at dusting, so what?

**Obi-Wan:** You are not who you think you are Mr Suey, allow me to explain. _4 hours pass_... you see?

**Suey:** So I'm a Jedi, I have special powers...why tell me now?

**Obi-Wan:** An intergalactic war is on the horizon and you are our only hope.

**Suey:** Well let's go get em, whoever they are.

**Obi-Wan:** Patience, Mr Suey... One young Jedi will not be enough to overcome the dark powers of this evil coven... there is another from your family that we must find.

**Suey:** Wow, you mean I've got a brother???

**Obi-Wan:** Not, exactly.

_Courtney enters_

**Courtney:** I Found these 2 things hanging off the tree we crashed into. _he's holding a bag of dog poo and a wing mirror_

**Obi-Wan:** YOU crashed in to Courtney... Well that's one of the wing mirrors

**Courtney:** Oh, is it important?

**Obi-Wan:** Clearly not, you never seem to use them.

**Courtney:** and this was hanging in the tree too...

**Obi-Wan:** _examining it more closely_ It appears to be some Canine Organic Matter, there must be some good reason it was left hanging in a tree. You should keep hold of it in case it becomes useful. Come on Mr Suey, follow us, we need to travel to the remote space outpost Flash _ahahhh... they all look up and around trying to work out where the noise came from_.

**Suey:** Calamity love, I'm just off out for a bit.

**Calamity:** Don't forget to get my bunion cream

_curtains close as they leave_

## Act 1 Scene 3

**Dorothy:** Oh I'm looking forward to this Ken, I've never been in a cave before.

**Ken:** Well Dorothy, the thing with caves is they can be quite small, and it looks like there's an awful lot of people coming on this tour with us. Look at 'em. Are you ALL here for the tour? I say, are you all here for the tour? Honestly some of them seem a bit simple!

**Dorothy:** Ken!!!!!

**Ken:** Look at that young lad there, he's got long hair - could do with a trip to the barber's him... short back and sides.

**Dorothy:** Shhhh Ken... Ohh look, this must be our guide. He looks like a proper adventurer, like that Bear Grylls.

**Ken:** Lad looks like he couldn't explore his way out of a paper bag.

**Bearass:** Good morning ladies and gentlemen, my name is Bearathhh and I will be your guide today.

**Ken:** Sorry son, did you say bear arse?

**Bearass:** No! Bearathhhhh... my father was Spanish.

**Dorothy:** Ooooooh, Spanish, how exotic, did you hear that Ken, his father was Spanish.

**Ken:** I don't trust the Spaniards... I don't trust ANY kind of foreigners.

**Dorothy:** _sadly_ I know you don't Ken... I know you don't. Well, I'm Dorothy, and this is my husband, Ken.

**Bearass:** This morning I shall be taking you deep beneath the surface of the earth, the final frontier, we'll boldly go where no one has gone before!

**Ken:** So this is the first time you've ever done this tour then lad?

**Bearass:** _confused_ No... we've been doing this tour 5 times a day for years...

**Ken:** Well, you've already got my back up then fella-mi-lad... "Where no one's gone before", false advertising... I could have you for that.

**Dorothy:** quiet Ken, let the nice young man speak

**Bearass:** We shall go on a journey down into the Blue John Cavern, a place of mystery and wonder...

**Ken:** Well, it had better be good, the price we paid, nearly 5 pound each...

**Dorothy:** Oh shush Ken, we got vouchers out of the newspaper. _to Bearass_ we're retired you see. Ken used to be an engineer, but he had to stop, what with his hearing and everything

**Ken:** I invented the Flipomater... _Bearass looks non-plussed_ No? Honestly, the young people these days, they know nothing. It's the machine that sticks the lids on jars of jam. Oh, no wonder the country's going to the dogs!

**Dorothy:** Ken!

**Bearass:** Now as we descend into the depths of the cavern, the floor can become rather slippy, so please, watch your step Ken

**Ken:** Don't tell me what to do son, I worked for Kellogs for 15 years! If I want to fall over, I'll flipping well fall over.

**Dorothy:** _to Bearass_ We'll be careful love _slaps Ken's arm. They move carefully to the other side of the stage_

**Bearass:** So we are now in the heart of the Blue John Cavern...

**Dorothy:** _pointing at some spiky rocks sticking out of the ground_ what are those?

**Bearass:** Ah, excellent question Dorothy... Those are stalagmites, they form as deposits of calcium carbonate are precipitated from the cave ceiling.

**Ken:** I was going to say that...

**Dorothy:** And what about these _pointing at a pair of tights dangling from above_?

**Ken:** _interrupting to appear clever_ Ah, I expect those are stalactites, formed by the solution of colloidial limestone particles forming a speleotherm over a period of millions of years.

**Bearass:** Actually Ken, this is just where I hang my washing, Blue John is surprisingly good at absorbing moisture.

**Dorothy:** Oh, that's interesting isn't it Ken? _to Bearass_ I've got a tumble dryer myself.

**Ken:** It's a Hotpoint, very reliable. Not like some of these German appliances...

**Bearass:** _starting to get annoyed with Ken_ The other thing you may not know about the Blue John stone is that it purifies the atmosphere. Just take a deep breath, I doubt you've ever experienced such clean air in all your... _fart noise, Bearass screws up his face in disgust_

**Ken:** Oh... sorry... that was me. I had a sausage roll in your visitor centre and it didn't agree with me.

**Dorothy:** He shouldn't have pastry, he's got a condition.

**Ken:** It's not a condition Dorothy, I just have an extremely efficient digestive system.

**Dorothy:** Of course you have Ken.

**Bearass:** If we could just get back to the tour... Now I have a piece of Blue John here, see how smooth it is...

**Ken:** Let's have a look at that son...

**Dorothy:** Don't touch it Ken... it's dangerous... I read in the paper that Blue John can send people quite mad.

**Ken:** Don't be silly Dorothy!

**Dorothy:** Well Brenda from the WI had some Blue John earrings, and she fell over in Sainsburys _to Bearass_ into the carrots.

**Ken:** _rolling his eyes_ She's 97 Dorothy... and she'd been drinking sherry all morning at The Bridge Club.

**Dorothy:** Well, I'm just saying... You can't be too careful!

**Bearass:** Again, if we could just stick to the tour. I'm going to ask you to switch off your torches, and we'll see just how dark it is down here.

**Dorothy:** Oh Ken, I don't think I like the idea of being down here in the dark.

**Ken:** Oh get a grip woman, nothing's going to happen, and even if it did, these nice people would warn us, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? You see there's nothing to worry about at all.

_they all switch off their lights. As Bearass delivers his line the Damebots walk onstage, brushing into Dorothy, before ending up at the middle back of the stage_

**Bearass:** Observe how the Blue John gives off a marvellous glow

**Dorothy:** Stop it Ken, not here!

**Ken:** Eh... I didn't do anything.

**Dorothy:** Well something just brushed against my leg!

**Ken:** It'll be that Spaniard, I told you they can't be trusted, now look here sonny-Jim, you keep away from my wife or I'll a give you a proper dealing with, I spent 3 years in the Boy's Brigade!

**Bearass:** Madam, please don't spray perfume in here, it can damage the rock formations...

**Dorothy:** I didn't spray anything...

**Ken:** Oooooh, it smells like a cat's been turned inside out... in our downstairs loo.

**Dorothy** _sniffs_ oh you're right, it smells like Febreze! But I didn't spray anything. _lights back on, two Damebots have appeared behind them at the back of the stage looking "warlike"_

**Bearass:** Well, I can't see anyone else here... can you?

**Ken:** I can't see anyone?

**Dorothy:** No, I can't see anyone here either?

_audience participation - behind you etc_

**Bearass:** _noticing the Damebots_ Oh, we seem to have some latecomers. Could I see your tickets please?

**Damebots:** We do not need tickets. _Step forward_ We are the Damebots _Step forward_ We will annihalate those who demand to see tickets. _Damebots turn toward Bearass, there is a flash and Bearass is thrown to the ground by a force which came from the Damebots. The Damebots continue their march down the aisle to the rear of the hall. Ken thinks something's gone wrong with his hearing aid and Dorothy is questioning what his problem is - they haven't noticed what happened to Bearass._

**Ken:** This flippin' hearing aid's playing up again Dorothy

**Dorothy:** What's the matter Ken, what just happened?

**Damebots:** All hail The Dames

_Dames walk on_

**Ken:** Dorothy, it's blokes dressed as women

**Dorothy:** Ken!! you can't say that sort of thing anymore _to one of the Dames_ I'm sorry love, he's a bit behind the times.

**Florence:** Silence! We are not men, we are The Dames, and we are now in control of this eyeshadow production facility.

**Beatrice:** You will begin mining immediately _they give Ken and Dorothy small tools_

**Ken:** What are these??? These won't work. They don't have the necessary torque to deal with stone this dense. I should know, I was in charge of the Channel Tunnel project. Allow me to educate you about the geological manifestation of this particular area, you see...

**Jackie:** Silence! You will begin digging

**Ken:** I can't do digging, It's my back you see... I've got a blue badge!

**Dorothy:** Oh be quiet Ken... He only got it so he could park nearer the library.

**Gertrude:** This is your final warning. You will do as we command, or... _points at a convulsing Bearass who is still on the floor_

**Dorothy:** I think we should do what they say Ken, look what they did to that lovely Bearass.

**Ken:** Oooooh 'eck!

_lights out curtains close_

## Act 1 Scene 4

**Courtney:** Welcome aboard this scheduled flight to the remote space outpost Flash _ahhhhhh, everyone looks to see where that's coming from_. Before we take off I need you to pay attention to this short safety briefing. Your seatbelts are fastened like this _demonstrates_. In the unlikely event that we land on water your lifejackets are _opens a crate it's empty except for a rubber chicken_ oh... Well the emergency exits are... erm... I'm not actually sure, just go back the way you came in I suppose. In a few moments we'll begin the onboard refreshment service, in the meantime, please sit back and enjoy your.. _OWBB Interrupts_

**Obi-Wan:** Never mind all that Courtney, time is of the essence, we need to take off, the future of the galaxy is at stake.

**Courtney:** Right'o _sound of engine starting, clunky gear changes, bad takeoff, everyone thrown left and right_

**Suey:** This is amazing, what is it?

**Obi-Wan:** This is a top-of-the-range Skoda Hyperspeed XL Star Gobbler. We call her the Minelium Falco... The Melamine Falc no, The Magnolia no, The Lemoniee, Minel.... Oh... we call her Betsy.

**Suey:** Wow!

**Courtney:** It's got a state-of-the-art, on-board computer system, which has the latest AI voice recognition capabilities. We call her Alexa. _shouting up at the roof_ Alexa, Engage Hyperdrive Autopilot.

**Alexa:** Playing songs by Engelbert Humperdink...

_Engelbert Humperdink song starts playing, everyone looks confused_

**Obi-Wan:** Alexa, stop! She has great trouble with his accent you see. Alexa, Engage Hyperdrive Autopilot.

**Alexa:** I'm sorry Hyperdrive Autopilot is not available without Prime membership. Would you like me to email details of the subscription rates.

**Obi-Wan:** What, no, oh for goodness sake... Courtney you'll just have to fly us through the Wincle Belt manually. Hold on, this could get bumpy!

**Courtney:** Right'o, here we go...

**Obi-Wan:** Careful Courtney, _pointing at the audience, before shouting_ Asteroids! _audience throw asteroids at the stage, the actors duck out of the way as best they can_ Some of them are getting through - shut the window Courtney.

**Courtney:** I can't the handle's broken!

**Alexa:** Impact detected... front shields 50%, direct hit to engine bay 3... downstairs toilet no longer operational.

_Courtney is desperately trying to steer through the asteroids with one hand whilst trying to take a selfie with the other_

**Obi-Wan:** This is not the time for Instagram Courtney, focus on flying!

**Courtney:** _once the asteroids have run out_ I can see Flash _ahhhhhh_

**Obi-Wan:** There's a clearing down there Courtney, try to land in there...

_Courtney desperately tries to land, but again there is a crashing sound, lights flash, bits of the interior fall off (boxes thrown on stage), the craft skids to a halt and the lights go out_

**Obi-Wan:** _in the darkness_ Is everyone alright?

**Suey:** I think so

**Courtney:** This is your captain speaking, thank you for flying with us today, we hope you have a very pleasant holiday and look forward to seeing you all again for the journey home.

## Act 1 Scene 5

**Petra:** Oh, hello, you're new here, there hasn't been another inmate on the prison planet Farton for, oh, as long as I've been here. Nice to have a bit of company. What's your name.

**Layabout:** Denise

**Petra:** Oh, lovely to meet you Denise. I'm G...

**Layabout:** _interrupting_ Look, I don't want to seem rude, but I'm just not interested in yer small-talk. If it's all the same to you, I'd rather you just kept yourself to yourself.

**Petra:** Oh, I see, well do you at least mind me asking what you're in for? I mean, I think I at least deserve to know if I've been locked up with a mass murderer... or worse!

**Layabout:** _sighs_ well if you really must know I was sent here by The Dames from their awful planet, just because they hate me, even though I've done nothing wrong.

**Petra:** Oh my stars, I don't believe it, we've got loads in common. I was sent here by the Dames too. I was leading a peaceful protest against the horrendous way they're destroying our environment, using up all the natural resources for their pointless cosmetics... So I started a movement. You must have heard of us? _hands her a leaflet_ Just Stop Dames! That's me there on the front of the leaflet. So anyway, I'm leading the protest march... I mean I say leading, but there was only me there, but from little acorns etc etc... Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, I'm peacefully protesting, as is my right, and these two nasty little robot things came out, arrested me. I had no legal representation, which is a breach of my human rights, and next thing I know, I'm here, on the planet stench, on my own... until you turned up that is!

**Layabout:** Mmmmm, what a fascinating story!

**Petra:** I know. Anyway, you can help me, I'm digging a tunnel _shows her a teaspoon_ with this. We're going to escape. Then you can join Just Stop Dames and help in the fight against tyrrany...

**Layabout:** Look, I'm sorry, but it all sounds like a lot of effort, and I'll be honest, I don't mind it here. I can do what I like without anyone bossing me about - I like it.

**Petra:** But what about the future of our Galaxy. They're destroying planets, they're leading us into an environmental catastrophe. What will we tell future generations?

**Layabout:** Tell em to stop moping about and whinging!

**Petra:** We need to go back to The Planet Of The Dames

**Layabout:** I'd rather just sit and read my fashion magazine.

**Petra:** Oh, shall I get that for you?

**Layabout:** No need... _she closes her eyes, there is a strange noise and her copy of Onesie Weekly "floats through the air" into her hand_

**Petra:** What on... how did you do that...

**Layabout:** Can't everyone do that?

**Petra:** What? No... oh my... you must be a... Jedi!!!!

**Layabout:** What's a Jedi?

**Petra:** What's a Jedi???? What's a J... You don't know about the Jedi. Let me tell you about the Jedi, I'm a massive fan. See him _points at a poster of OWBB looking heroic_, on the wall up there, he's my favourite. Oh now that I know you're a Jedi, you HAVE to help dig us out

**Layabout:** Why bother digging when you could just blow a hole in the wall... with your mind?

**Petra:** What??? You could do that? Oh my goodness, I'm so excited, we're getting out of here, go on, blow a hole in the wall with your mind.

**Layabout:** No, yer alright! _she goes back to reading Onesie Weekly, Petra stares at the audience in disbelief, then eventually goes back to digging with her teaspoon, lights go down, curtains close_

## Act 1 Scene 6

**Dorothy:** Oh Ken, I can't take much more of this, I'm exhausted.

**Ken:** What can we do Dorothy, what can we do???

**Dorothy:** I'm going to check on Mr Bearass... see if he's alright... you keep an eye out for those Dame ladies _she moves over to Bearass_ Mr Bearass, are you alright, they gave you an awful shock, I don't know what we should do

**Bearass:** Dorothy, we need to disable those Damebots, they're clearly some kind of cybernetic war machines. We need to create a massive electro-magnetic-pulse to destroy their microprocessors.

**Dorothy:** Oh, I don't know anything about all that computer stuff. Ken's got a laptop, but he mainly uses it for complaining to the council.

**Bearass:** _whispering_ Dorothy, I have a compass on my toolbelt, that has a weak magnetic force, but if we could find something to amplify that force, well, we may just stand a chance of making a Wasbinator.

**Dorothy:** Oh, I think you're talking to the wrong person, it's Ken that usually deals with all this, I tend to look after the gardening and whatnot. Wait a minute... did you say amplify? Well Ken's got a hearing aid. Is that a kind of amplifier?

**Bearass:** You're a genius Dorothy, that might just work.

**Dorothy:** Ken, Ken, _whispering_ we need your hearing aid.

**Ken:** What?

**Dorothy:** _slightly louder_ we need your hearing aid

**Ken:** Speak up woman, I can't hear a word you're saying.

**Dorothy:** _right next to him, shouting_ WE NEED YOUR HEARING AID

**Ken:** _rocks back in shock at the loud noise_ There's no need to shout Dorothy!!! _he takes his hearing aid out, passes it to Dorothy, who passes it to Bearass_

**Bearass:** OK, snip that wire there, join that to my compass here, wrap the whole thing in a bit of tinfoil from my sandwich box... there, it won't win any design awards, but it might just do the trick. Dorothy, I need you to attract the Damebots within range, then we can try deploying The Wasbinator

**Dorothy:** Me and Ken could sing a song, Ken was in a group in the 60's

**Ken:** We were called The Hinges!

**Dorothy:** They supported The Doors!

SONG

_During the song Dorothy signals to Bearass who turns on the Wasbinator, there is a crackling noise and a flash. The Damebots fall to the ground convulsing, then are still_

**Ken:** By eck lad, you did it, you've absolutely destroyed 'em.

**Dorothy:** Oh your Wasbinator thingy, it's killed them. The poor things!

**Ken:** I've got to say, I think I may have underestimated you.

**Bearass:** Thank you Ken, but I couldn't have done it without Dorothy here.

**Ken:** What's that, speak up lad, I can't hear a word you're saying.

**Dorothy:** Come on Ken we need to get out before The Dames come back.

**Bearass:** Don't worry, I know these caves like the back of my hand, we need to head due south from here. We'll be out of here in no time. Let me just check my compass... Oh... _looks at his compass which is completely destroyed_ That's not good.

_one of the Damebots starts to shakily move its arm, then begins to sit up, they have clearly not been destroyed. The other Damebot starts recovering and they both get to their feet. The curtains close_

Have you been travelling for light years, need fuel, or pasties. Why not stop at "Flash Star Stores", just off junction 47 of Galactiway 66.

## Act 2 Scene 1

[The interior of the petrol station at Flash Star Stores]

**Suey:** Why are we here Mr Bogie?

**Obi-Wan:** We need to know the whereabouts of your sibling Mr Suey. Many strange people pass through this place, gossip will be exchanged, information traded. The owner of this establishment has often been of assistance to me... But be careful, not everyone here is to be trusted. You can run into all sorts of characters.

**Suey:** Sounds like a night at the WI - I don't go meself obviously, but our Calamity does, and the tales she tells me.

**Obi-Wan:** _annoyed_ I very much doubt her "WI" has anything like the sort of low-life vagabonds who frequent this place.

**Suey:** Oh, you'd be surprised, there's a woman who sits at the back and she...

**Obi-Wan:** _Annoyed_ Be discreet Mr Suey, stay quiet, let me do the talking, and try not to make eye contact. _a 6-eyed alien walks in and stares at Suey, he tries to look away but it keeps staring at him_. Ah... there she is... _a pink space octopus is busy serving customers. She has an Italian accent. Amongst others, the Big Gulp Bunny is standing in the queue, holding a bunch of carrots and looking impatient._

**Debra:** which-a pump-a number you-a been-a to-a my friend-a? _alien mumble_... Numero 5-a, OK, 60000 intastellas... _alien outburst_. Whaddayamean its a twice the price as last time... you know issa difficult to get space-diesel these days? _alien pulls gun, Debra snatches it from him and waves it in his face, grabs his debit card and taps it to pay, then throws it back and shoots a warning shot past the alien's feet_, maybe you go-a somewhere else-a next-a time eh? _alien runs out screaming. Debra spots OBWBB_. Well-a, if it isnt my old-a friend-a, Da Bigga Da Bogie. How you been mi amore? _whispers_ It's a been a long-a time-a since we... you know... _winks (if a space octopus can wink!)_.

**Obi-Wan:** Good to see you Debra, you still seem to have a way with your customers.

**Debra:** They-a drive-a me crazy, but you, we have a special relationship no? _whispering_ Whadda-you need? Guns? Drugs?... Girls? Confectionary????!? _she waves a Mars bar at him provocatively_

**Obi-Wan:** No Debra, we're not here for Mars bars.

**Debra:** Ahhh, maybe this-a strapping young lad is here for a job eh? I could do with an extra pair of hands...Ha ha ha.

**Obi-Wan:** No Debra... we're here for information.

**Debra:** Informatzionio eh? You hear that _gesturing at other customers_, he needs-a da gossip... Well, issa still gonna cost-ya Bogie Man... one way or another _winks again_.

**Obi-Wan:** We're interested in the whereabouts of _whispers...._

**Debra:** Ooooh, royalty eh? And Jedi royalty too! Issa gonna cost extra.

**Obi-Wan:** Do you know where we can find this individual?

**Debra:** Mmmm, I notta hear anything from the, how you say, usual suspects, but you 'ave a browse o da pick-and-a-mix-a, and I'll put some feelers out, ha ha ha... No, seriously, I make a few enquiries eh?

**Obi-Wan:** Time is of the essence Debra, the fate of a planet is at stake.

**Debra:** _slightly annoyed_ Eh, maybe you think I gotta nothing betta to do-a. Eh, look at me... my hands are full. Maybe you need to learn a little patience eh?

**Obi-Wan:** Come Mr Suey, to the Pick-and-mix.
_Suey and OWBB move across to an impressive looking pick-n-mix stand_

**Suey:** Well, she seems nice. Did, er you and her... you know?

**Obi-Wan:** Sometimes it is necessary to make great sacrifices in order to keep the universe in balance, so yes, there was a time when we... we held hands.

**Suey:** How did you know which one to...

**Dan Lothario:** Excuse me, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation with the, er, "thing", over there. It sounds very much like I may be able to help you. Allow me to introduce myself... I am Captain Dan Lothario, legend of the stars, defender of the weak, greatly appreciated by the ladies, Ding Dong, Fwah! I think you may be looking for _whispers_ and I happen to know their whereabouts. They are currently incarcerated on the prison planet Farton, a place I'm afraid I spent a brief spell myself, over a ridiculous misunderstanding with a short-tempered wine merchant.. and his good lady wife...

**Obi-Wan:** Can you take us there?

**Dan Lothario:** Well, my Space Jag is parked outside, but she's a bit of an eyecatcher, might attract too much attention... especially female attention if you know what I mean, wooof!

**Courtney:** _enters, covered in oil and dirt_ It's no use, I can't fix it, the engine won't start, the stereo's only playing Radio 4, and the toilet's completely...

**Dan Lothario:** _interrupting_ it would appear that you have two problems old chap. You require a guide to take you to Farton, AND you need someone, _looking at Courtney and rolling his eyes_ who knows what they're doing, to repair your spacecraft. Allow me to introduce my companion. _WD40 rolls on stage_ This is WD40. He can repair any kind of mechanical problem you may have, he can lubricate gears and chains... and he's quite good at getting stains out of expensive upholstery.

**WD40:** Your engine has been thrashed... what kind of incompetent _bleep_ has been flying that clapped out piece of _bleeeep_? _Courtney looks downcast_

**Dan Lothario:** Ha, forgive WD40's bedside manner, he's not very good at the whole social chit chat thing, likes to speak his mind... but he WILL be able to fix your ship and then we can all blow off to Farton, so to speak... As long as our terms are acceptable?

**Obi-Wan:** You will receive everything you deserve, do not worry about that. But your little droid must get to work immediately, I can feel a worrying disturbance in The Force.

**Courtney:** It's probably that milk you had on your Shreddies, I told you the Falcon's fridge wasn't working properly... it smelt minging!

**OWBB:** Courtney, take our new friend and his little droid to the Melamine Falc.. the Moleskin Fulc... Take them to Betsy!

**WD40:** _as they all leave stage_ who is he calling a "little droid", these humans are so rude, I'll _bleeeping_ _bleep_ his head so far up his _bleeping_ _bleeep_ that he'll think he's fallen into a black hole!

**OWBB:** I think I'll just purchase a few Pick-N-Mix, for the journey. _He smooths his eyebrows, and heads provocatively towards Debra_

## Act 2 Scene 2

[Back in the Blue John Cavern]

_Ken has been stripped to his underwear and is tied up ready to be tortured_

**Ken:** Don't think you can intimidate me with your threats. You don't scare me, I used to fly submarines... in the war.

**Damebot 1**: You must be punished for your insurrection

**Ken:** _Looking down at his crotch_ I don't know what you're talking about... Oh, you mean our little rebellion, well this is hardly the way to treat a prisoner of war. It's against the Geneva Convention.

**Damebot 2**: You will be tortured until you tell us everything you know.

**Ken:** Tell you everything I know. Ha, I've forgotten more than you'll ever learn you cheeky young whippersnappers. You might think you're clever with your cybernetic techno-malarky, but I spent 5 years at NASA... designing the teasmaid for the Apollo 11 mission... and they went to the moon with that! Buzz Aldrin said that was the best cup of PG Tips he'd ever had, smashing fella was Buzz.

**Damebots**: All hail The Dames

_Dames enter - one has a beard... One is drinking a can of Stella. Another is scratching their backside! Damebots leave the stage_

**Ken:** Oooooh 'eck they're starting to look quite tough!

**Jackie:** What time does the footie kick off?

**Gertrude:** BURP!!!!

**Florence:** So, you think you can outwit The Dames with your silly little Wasbinator do you?

**Beatrice:** You cannot defeat the mighty Dame species, we are invincible.

**Jackie:** But we need to know how you created such a large power surge. We will steal this technology and become even more invincible.

**Ken:** strictly speaking, I don't think you can become MORE invincible. You see it means you're impossible to defeat, I mean you can't become MORE impossible to defeat. It's from the Latin, invincibilis... _he is interrupted_

**Florence:** Quiet. You will explain your amplification system.

**Beatrice:** Or we will MAKE you

**Bearass:** _from off stage_ Don't tell him Ken, if they get their hands on the Wasbinator, then heaven help us.

**Dorothy:** _from off stage_ oh, please don't torture him... he's got athlete's foot

**Ken:** don't worry Dorothy, they won't break me, _to the Dames_ I was in 'Nam you know. I saw things in 'Nam that I wouldn't wish on anyone.

**Dorothy:** You were in Chelt'nam Ken, he worked on the checkout at Kwiksave.

**Florence:** Begin... the dissing...

**Ken:** The... what... oh, no, no, not that, anything but that!

**Beatrice:** Look at his legs, I've seen bigger drumsticks in the freezer section on the planet Aldi.

**Ken:** Aaaaaghhhh... no stop it, please.

**Gertrude:** Go on Florence, throw some shade, diss him some more.

**Ken:** No, please, I can't take it...

**Florence:** Look at his nose, you could dig for truffles with that!

**Ken:** Aaaaaghhhh!

**Jackie:** _pointing towards Ken's crotch_ Hey girls, it wouldn't cost much to send that package

**Ken:** Aaaaaghhhh!

_Damebots both come back on stage. Damebot 2 is holding a container of blue eyeshadow_

**Damebot 1**: The digging has been a success.

**Damebot 2**: _offering up the container_ The first batch is prepared.

**Florence:** _grabbing the container_ Give me some of that, where's the mirror _strides purposefully off stage, sounds of her smearing it over her eyes, werewolf-type transformation SFX, maybe bright blue light flickers from offstage, she returns wearing a huge blue wig... she has become a super Dame_. I've never felt so feminine, I have become... Super Dame!

_the other Dames all run offstage, shouting, give me some of that eyeshadow, I'm first etc as Florence stands triumphant and Ken looks terrified_

**Florence:** I am more beautiful than ever. I am a queen. I am YOUR queen. I am queen of everything. You will bow down and worship me. As Super Dames, conquering one planet is just the beginning, we shall take the whole universe! Nothing can stand in our way!!!

**Ken:** Ohhhhh eck!!!

_lights out, curtains close_

## Act 2 Scene 3

[Prison cell on Farton]

**Layabout:** I really don't know why you're bothering, even if you manage to tunnel through the wall, there's nothing out there, and it stinks. You'd just be outside in the smelly emptiness.

**Petra:** We HAVE to do something, or what will we tell future generations?

**Layabout:** tell em to calm down and stop being so annoying

**Petra:** Shhhh... I think I can hear something...

_We hear muffled voices, there's a crumbling noise and the sound of Suey shouting "we're nearly through"... and the tunnel is completed. Suey emerges.. Prisoner is delighted_

**Petra:** Who on earth are you.

**Suey:** I'm Mr Suey, you must be my brother... the other Jedi?

**Petra:** Firstly, I'm a woman, although I try not to deal in gender-specific stereotypes and fully respect the rights of anyone to be who they want to be. And secondly, Jedi??? I wish I was, I'm a massive fan of the Jed... _OWBB enters_ I don't believe it... _Petra points at the poster on the wall_ It's you!

**Obi-Wan:** Goodness, that's a very old picture. _He admires his former self and pouts at the audience, before remembering why they are there_. Mr Suey, allow me to introduce you to... your Sister... Princess Layabout.

**Suey:** Oh wow, I've got a sister, hiya...

**Layabout:** _totally uninterested_ Yeah, what-ever... _Looks him up and down very briefly_ I doubt we'll get on, you're nothing like me.

_Then Dan Lothario comes through the tunnel complaining that his suit is covered in dust_.

**Dan Lothario:** This place hasn't changed a bit, still smelly and dusty and... oh hello... _spotting Layabout_ who's this? You weren't here last time... nice onesie!

**Layabout:** _Clearly in lurve at first sight_ Oh.....

_Petra is asking OWBB for his autograph_

**Petra:** if you could just put "To my best mate...", and then I'll spell my name out cos it's quite complicated, it's P~

**Obi-Wan:** _interrupting_ I'll just put "All The Best, Obi-Wan Big Bogie"

**Petra:** Oh _disappointed_, can I have a selfie?

**Obi-Wan:** No! _to Jedis_ My young apprentices... Your potential is great, but you have much to learn. I shall teach you all that I know. _Petra is trying to take selfies and becoming annoying_. Sorry, I don't know your name...

**Petra:** Oh the name's P~

**Obi-Wan:** _Interrupting_ I don't NEED to know your name, I NEED to train these young apprentices in the ways of the Jedi, so if you don't mind... _Petra looks very sad, gets sympathy from the audience, OWBB has banter with them "oh don't encourage her etc" until he relents_. Very well, why don't you go outside and bring my Jedi equipment bag... it's in the boot... of the spacecraft...

**Petra:** Oh, thank you Mr Big Bogie, it would be an honour Mr Big Bogie... _she leaves_

_Layabout and Dan Lothario are flirting, Suey keeps trying to speak to her but she keeps ignoring him. He begins complaining to the audience_

**Suey:** I can't believe this, I've come half way across the universe in a battered old spaceship, I've drilled through this prison wall, I've found a long lost sister I never knew I had... and she doesn't even want to talk to me... _looks sad, ahhhh, I'm sadder than that!_

**Petra:** _returns with light sabres in duffel bag_ I've got them Mr Bogie, just like you asked. Why does your spaceship smell of dog poo?

**Obi-Wan:** _ignores the dog poo question and impatiently points at the bag she has brought in_ Well come on then, get on with it _Petra removes inflatable light sabres from the bag and attempts to inflate the first, without success. Dan Lothario steps in and inflates one with ease, impressing Layabout even more. He passes it romantically to Layabout_.

**Layabout:** _Showing her lightsabre to OWBB_ What's this for???

**Obi-Wan:** This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.

**Layabout:** But I don't know how to fight...

**Obi-Wan:** Allow me to share with both of you the experience of a thousand Jedi warriors...

_Montage, Light sabres, running on the spot, star jumps, OWBB has a stopwatch, and a clipboard, YO-YOs, blindfolds, drop tennis balls on string from above etc etc_
_Petra finds a mirrorball in OWBB's bag of stuff. She makes it levitate, no-one notices._

**Obi-Wan:** I have taught you everything I know.

**Suey:** That was quick

**Obi-Wan:** We must now plan our mission - The Dames have invaded Earth in order to meet their insatiable desire for blue eyeshadow. They are large in number... and in dress size! We must find their achilles heel, some weakness which will help us

**Layabout:** _confidently_ Strictly Come Dancing

**Everyone**: Sorry... What???

**Layabout:** _explaining further_ Strictly Come Dancing, they're mad for it. As soon as it comes on they're in a different world, you can't get a word out of them. Strictly Come Dancing is their achilles heel!

**Obi-Wan:** Interesting... _he is clearly deep in thought_ We must get back to earth, the final battle is almost upon us. _OWBB and Suey leave_

**Petra:** Wait for me...

**Suey:** _from offstage_ Come on Sis!

_Curtains close with Layabout and Lothario stood in front_

**Layabout:** I've got to go... will I see you again?

**Dan Lothario:** But of course, you're the most wonderful woman I've met this week. You join your new-age hippy friends, I'll follow in my Space Jag and once you've "saved the world", you and I can take a trip round the stars and get to know each other.

[SONG: Starship Trooper]

## Act 2 Scene 4

[back in the Blue John Mine]

_Ken, Dorothy and Bearass are hard at work, as the Damebots monitor them with their backs to the audience. The Jedis enter from the back, and creep down the aisle, light-sabres at the ready_

**Obi-Wan:** Now, remember your training my young Jedi. Move quickly, but silently, feel the force coursing through your veins. Channel that energy like hundreds of your kind have done before...

**Suey:** _completely missing the mood_ And then whack 'em with our light-sabres?

**Obi-Wan:** _disappointed that his young apprentice doesn't share his love for the poetic..._ Yes, yes... whack them with your light-sabres.

**Suey and Layabout:** _together and excitedly_ MINT!! Let's get em!

_The Damebots are alerted by the outburst and turn to face the Jedi. A battle ensues, with lots of banter between Suey and Layabout, high fiving as they help each other out. Ken, Dot and Bearass sneak off stage. Eventually the Damebots are defeated. The Dames enter, all wearing blue "superdame" wigs._

**Florence:** Well well well, what do we have here? If it isn't the last of the Jedi. You're a bit old to be doing this kind of thing aren't you?

**Beatrice:** And who's this, _sarcastically_ he looks like Iron Man!

**Jackie:** That's good, I've got a big pile of bloomers. _holding up a big basket of brightly coloured knickers_ These need ironing!

**Gertrude:** Ooooh, he'll definitely need The Force to get through them. _The Dames all laugh at Suey_

**Florence:** And you _pointing at Layabout_, aren't you supposed to be in prison?

**Beatrice:** _to Obi-Wan_ I wouldn't rely on this one, she's so lazy she had a snooze-button fitted to the smoke alarm!

**Jackie:** Yeah, she's the only person I know with an Energy Saving Mode!

**Layabout:** I've changed, I've met people who believe in me, a family, and friends, who... Love Me!

**Dames**: _Mocking_ Ooooooh... they LOOOOOVE Me!

**Florence:** Well you're no match for our Damely put-downs. Get her Beatrice.

**Jackie:** Yeah, give her one of your Craig Revell-Hallwood lines!

**Beatrice:** _In a Craig Revell-Hallwood sneering style_ There are only two things stopping YOU winning Strictly... Your feet!

**Florence:** Ooooh, let me have a go... It's like your toes are all pointing the wrong way... Have you got mixamatosis?

**Obi-Wan:** This is no good, our Jedi powers are strong, but we cannot compete with Panto-Power. _shouting down the aisle_ Courtney... we must play our trump card. _Loud fart sound, OWBB looks exasperated_ No Courtney... unleash the secret weapon. _Courtney has a massive ghetto-blaster on his shoulder, and presses Play. The Strictly theme plays out of his tinny speakers_

**Florence:** _looking down the aisle, sarcastically asks_ Is that Anton Du Beke?

**Beatrice:** More like "Anton Ooooh Eck!!!!"

_The Dames laugh and continue to take the mickey out of the Jedi characters_

**Obi-Wan:** This isn't working, something is missing...

_Petra enters, holds both hands up to the ceiling and with a face full of concentration, uses The Force to lower a mirrorball down from above. The other Jedi look on in awe and the Dames begin to notice._

**Beatrice:** Ooooh Strictly

_The main lights go off, a single light hits the mirrorball and the full Strictly theme tune plays out in all its glory. The Dames are paralyzed with wonder_

_Ken and Dorothy Tango on stage_

**Voiceover** Ken and Dorothy there with their tango. Let's see what the judges made of it.

_Each Dame delivers their verdict in turn and then stares at the mirrorball in a trance_

**Jackie** _In a slightly mad Italian style_ A Tango is supposed to be fizzy... and fruity... that was more like a weak-a orange squash... SIX-A points-a

**Beatrice** _sneering Craig R-H_ Ken, your turns were a dis-aster darliiing, DIS-AAASTER. I'll give them a FIVE because I'm feeling generous!

**Gertrude** _Very enthusiastic_ Well I disagree, they had energy energy energy. I loved it! NINE!

**Florence** _Len Goodman_ I agree... if those two don't get through to next week's show, I'll pickle my walnuts! SEVEN!!!

**Layabout** You see... I TOLD you Strictly was their achilles heel.

**Suey** _To OWBB_ Should we finish them off like?

**Obi-Wan** No Mr Suey. A Jedi's goal is to defend life, not take it. These... "ladies" have been consumed by a dark force, Blue John Eyeshadow destroys everything it meets, The Dames are its victims. We must take it away from them, for their own good, and to restore balance in the universe.

**Florence:** _Snapping out of the trance_ But we NEED Blue Eyeshadow, to keep us looking feminine.

**Dorothy:** I hope you don't mind me saying, I'd have mentioned it earlier, but I didn't want to interrupt, you seemed a bit busy, what with all that invading and tortuing and whatnot. Anyway, where was I... oh yes... Blue Eyeshadow... it doesn't really suit your skin tones, and it's SO last century. I've got my finger on the pulse of the make-up world. I'm a Tik Tok influencer, all the youngsters follow me, and I've got to tell you... It's all about orange these days!

**Beatrice:** Orange?

**Jackie:** What's orange?

**Gertrude:** Orange?

**Florence:** We don't understand, what is this "Orange" of which you speak?

**Dorothy:** I've got some here. _dabbing it onto the Dames_ It's completely organic, environmentally friendly, hypo-allergenic, easy to find on ALL the fashionable planets and... best of all... It looks fabulous!

**Florence:** Ooooh, that feels lovely. Very calming.

**Beatrice:** Oooh, I see what you mean, I feel womanly, but without the catty-ness!

**Jackie:** Oh, I agree. I feel very chilled out!

**Gertrude:** Does anyone fancy a bit of yoga?

**Dorothy:** You see... it's all natural and MUCH better for your mental health. You can find the recipe on my Instagram page.

**Florence:** Oh, Dorothy, we're so sorry for all that "We are The Dames" nonsense.

**Beatrice:** I suppose we were all just a bit stressed?

**Jackie:** Yes, sorry for torturing you Ken, it was nothing personal.

**Gertrude:** Does anyone fancy some tofu?

**Dorothy:** _unties the dames_ well, no real harm done, I think Ken's a bit traumatised, but he's had worse.

**Ken:** Oh, I'm fine, it'll take more than a few fat blokes in dresses to bother me, no offence love...

**Florence:** Well, we'd better get back home, come along ladies.

_Dames all bid farewell to Dorothy... bye Dorothy, nice to meet you etc..._

**Obi-Wan:** Dorothy, the Force is strong within you. Have you ever considered becoming a Jedi.

**Dorothy:** Oh goodness no, I've got more than enough on my plate what with YouTube and TikTok and Instagram, and Ken. Come on Ken, I think we'd better get home before you get into any more scrapes. _K&D say their farewells and exit_.

**Obi-Wan:** _turning to Petra_ I owe you an apology erm... _he doesn't know her name_

**Petra:** It's Petra!

**Obi-Wan:** Well, Petra, you have proved to be a formidable young Padawan. _knights her with a lightsaber_ I bestow upon you the title "Jedi Knight". _He then hands her the lightsaber. Petra is beside herself with glee, does a few swishes with the lightsaber and runs off stage giggling_

**Suey:** Well I should be getting back home. Calamity will be worried sick... Can I get a lift back Courtney?

**Courtney:** Err, yeah, no problem, if you're not afraid of my driving?

**Suey:** No, I think you did a great job getting us here. I believe in you.

**Obi-Wan:** Come on then Mr Suey, let's get you home... _OWBB, Petra and Courtney all leave stage_

**Suey:** _noticing that Layabout is looking sad in the corner_ Eh, sis, what's up?

**Layabout:** Captain Dan Lothario promised to pick me up and take me for a ride. I think he's dumped me... I feel like such a fool.

**Suey:** Oh, err, I think I saw him taking off in his Space Jag with that octopus woman. You're better off without him. Why don't you come back with us?

**Layabout** What? Really?

**Suey** Well yeah. I've never had a sister before, and now I have, well, that's great innit?. Come on, you need to meet Calamity, she's a bit of an acquired taste like but, you know, that's families for ya!

**Layabout:** Great! _all except Bearass exit_

**Bearass:** _to the audience_ well ladies and gentlemen, back to the tour. Now this cavern is particularly interesting due to the unusual calcium deposits which you can just make out on the ceiling. If I shine my torch up there _the lights go out_ Oh dear... I think the batteries have gone. _curtains close_

## Act 2 Scene 5

_Suey, Layabout, OWBB and Courtney enter Suey and Calamity's front room_

**Suey:** So this is it, nothing special but, you know, we call it home. D'ya fancy a Coke?

**Layabout:** I LOVE Coke

**Suey:** Really??? I LOVE Coke. How about some "Dippers Fried Chicken"?

**Layabout:** I LOVE fried chicken!

**Suey:** I LOVE fried chicken! What about a curly wurly?

**Layabout:** Whats a curly wurly? _Suey gives her a Curly Wurly, she tries it_ I LOVE curly wurly?

**Suey:** Oh this is great, we've got so much in common as well as all the Jedi stuff of course. Just a minute _shouts offstage towards "Calamity"_ Calam, you're never gonna believe it... I've been into space. I've met a pink octopus. I've trained as a Jedi warrior, we've defeated an army of Dames, and saved the galaxy. Oh, and I've got a sister.

**Calamity:** Suey, is that you? What time do you call this. Did you take the trash out. Have you fed the cats? Did you get my blue eyeshadow?

_Suey looks despairingly at the audience, while everyone else looks sympathetically at Suey. Lights down, curtains close_
