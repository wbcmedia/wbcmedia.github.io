# Planet Of The Dames - Songs

## Tragedy

Here we are, in a lost and lonely galaxy
Sisterhood, destroyed by her duplicity
Layabout, she's guilty that's beyond all doubt
And it's really got us feeling blue, feeling blue
What do we do?

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs are not enough and we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, our stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

Now she's gone, we need some kind of strategy
A masterplan, to save us from this misery
We're superdames, we only need to use our brains
To show the world that we are queens, we are queens, in ultramarine
We are supreme!

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs are not enough and we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, our stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

## Space Oddity

Ground Control to Major Tom
Dorothy to husband Ken

Ground Control to Major Tom
Dorothy to husband Ken

Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Take your back-pain pills and put your cardi on

Ground Control to Major Tom
Husband Ken to Dorothy

Commencing countdown, engines on
I think I may have sprained 'me knee

Check ignition and may God's love be with you
'mi shoulder's stiffnin' up and I really need a wee

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
This is Dot and Ken to anyone...

You've really made the grade
We think we've been enslaved

And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
And we wish we'd spent our weekend break elsewhere

Now it's time to leave the capsule, if you dare
Now it's time to leave this cavern if we dare

This is Major Tom to Ground Control
This is Dorothy to Cave Patrol

I'm stepping through the door
It's time to do your thi-i-i-ing

And I'm floating in a most peculiar way

And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in a tin can
For here we are singing in the darkness

Far above the world
Far below the world

Planet Earth is blue
This old cavern's blue

And there's nothing I can do
And we don't know what to do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
Though we've asked one hundred thousand times

I'm feeling very still
They wouldn't let us rest

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
And I think our tour-guide knows which way to go

Tell my man I love him very much, he knows
Tell my wife I love her very much, I know

Ground Control to Major Tom
Dorothy to husband Ken

Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Your hearing's dead, so I'll ask again

Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you-
Can you-

For here am I sitting in a tin can
For here we are singing in the darkness

Far above the world
Far below the world

Planet Earth is blue
This old cavern's blue

And there's nothing I can do
And we don't know what to do
