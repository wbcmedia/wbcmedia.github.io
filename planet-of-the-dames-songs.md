## Tragedy

Here we are, in a lost and lonely galaxy
Sisterhood, destroyed by her duplicity
Layabout, she's guilty that's beyond all doubt
And it's really got us feeling blue, feeling blue
What do we do?

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs aren't enough, we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

Now she's gone, we need some kind of strategy
A masterplan, to save us from this misery
We're superdames, we only need to use our brains
To show the world that we are queens, we are queens, in ultramarine
We are supreme!

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs aren't enough, we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

I think I may have sprained 'me knee

Am Am/G D/F#

'mi shoulder's stiffnin' up and I really need a wee

C E7

This is Dot and Ken to anyone...

Fmaj7

We think we've been enslaved

Fm C F

And we wish we'd spent our weekend break elsewhere

Now it's time to leave this cavern if we dare

Fmaj7 Em

For here we are singing in the darkness

Far below the world

Bb Am

This old cavern's blue

G F

And we don't know what to do

C E7

Though we've asked one hundred thousand times

They wouldn't let us rest

Fm C F

And I think my poor old back's about to go

Tell my wife I love her very much, I know

Dorothy to husband Ken

Your hearing's gone, so I'll ask again

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

G

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you-

Fmaj7 Em

Here we are singing in the darkness

Far below the world

This old cavern's blue

And we know just what to do

## Starship Trooper

Hey, captain Dan
won't you be my lover
you're the best thing
that I've ever discovered
Mum and Dad left me
they went to the stars
then the evil dames sentenced me to life behind bars

I'm captain Dan
I'm a hot-blooded stallion
Would you like to touch my shiny medallion
Cruising round the stars
In my flashy space-jag
Would you like to join me for a lovely excursion

I lost my heart
to a starship trooper
finding love in hyper space
This is more than infatuation
Hand in hand in a love-embrace

Listen captain Dan
You set my heart a'beating
My temperature's rising,
my onesie's overheating
Hold me, kiss me, do what you will
I want to feel that galactic thrill

I'm captain Dan
I'm a hot-blooded stallion
Would you like to touch my shiny medallion
Cruising round the stars
In my flashy space-jag
Would you like to join me for a lovely excursion

Now that I'm free and I've learned I'm a Jedi
Please don't say that we should say goodbye
Hush now, darling, don't say a word
I'll sweep you off your feet when you've saved the world

I lost my heart
to a starship trooper
finding love in hyper space
This is more than infatuation
Hand in hand in a love-embrace

## Finale Song

Go your own way
Just can't get enough
We are family
A little respect
Africa
Sweet dreams
Livin on a prayer
Atomic
Girls just want to have fun
Baby one more time (Make me Damely one more time)
Call me maybe
