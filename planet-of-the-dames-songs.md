## Tragedy

Here we are, in a lost and lonely galaxy
Sisterhood, destroyed by her duplicity
Layabout, she's guilty that's beyond all doubt
And it's really got us feeling blue, feeling blue
What do we do?

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs are not enough and we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, our stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

Now she's gone, we need some kind of strategy
A masterplan, to save us from this misery
We're superdames, we only need to use our brains
To show the world that we are queens, we are queens, in ultramarine
We are supreme!

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs are not enough and we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, our stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

Husband Ken to Dorothy

C Em

I think I may have sprained 'me knee

Am Am/G D/F#

'mi shoulder's stiffnin' up and I really need a wee

C E7

This is Dot and Ken to anyone...

Fmaj7

We think we've been enslaved

Fm C F

And we wish we'd spent our weekend break elsewhere

Now it's time to leave this cavern if we dare

Fmaj7 Em

For here we are singing in the darkness

Far below the world

Bb Am

This old cavern's blue

G F

And we don't know what to do

C E7

Though we've asked one hundred thousand times

Fmaj7

They wouldn't let us rest

Fm C F

And I think my poor old back's about to go

Tell my wife I love her very much, I know

G E7

Dorothy to husband Ken

Am C/G

Your hearing's gone, so I'll ask again

D7/F#

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

C

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

G

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you-

Fmaj7 Em

Here we are singing in the darkness

Far below the world

This old cavern's blue

And we know just what to do
