## Tragedy

Here we are, in a lost and lonely galaxy
Sisterhood, destroyed by her duplicity
Layabout, she's guilty that's beyond all doubt
And it's really got us feeling blue, feeling blue
What do we do?

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs are not enough and we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, our stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

Now she's gone, we need some kind of strategy
A masterplan, to save us from this misery
We're superdames, we only need to use our brains
To show the world that we are queens, we are queens, in ultramarine
We are supreme!

Tragedy, when the make up's gone and we can't go on
It's a tragedy, with naked eyes turning into guys
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare
Tragedy, wigs are not enough and we're looking rough
It's a tragedy, our stubble's grown testosterone
It's hard to bear, with no blue eyeshadow, a total nightmare

## Space Oddity

Dorothy to husband Ken

Dorothy to husband Ken

Take your back-pain pills and put your cardi on

Husband Ken to Dorothy

I think I may have sprained 'me knee

'mi shoulder's stiffnin' up and I really need a wee

This is Dot and Ken to anyone...

We think we've been enslaved

And we wish we'd spent our weekend break elsewhere

Now it's time to leave this cavern if we dare

For here we are singing in the darkness

Far below the world

This old cavern's blue

And we don't know what to do

Though we've asked one hundred thousand times

They wouldn't let us rest

And I think our tour-guide knows which way to go

Tell my wife I love her very much, I know

Dorothy to husband Ken

Your hearing's dead, so I'll ask again

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you hear me, Husband Ken?

Can you-

For here we are singing in the darkness

Far below the world

This old cavern's blue

And we don't know what to do
