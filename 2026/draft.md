- Candice enters carrying bags full of purchases from expensive shops

**_Candice_** : Hiya babes. Oh, you look awful, what's happened?

**_Gideon_** : The market's crashing. Woolworths, Amstrad, C&A. All down. I'm haemorrhaging money

**_Candice_** : Yeah, I don't know what hemjurring means. Anyway... I've seen the perfect place for my nail bar idea. On the high street. I'm trying to remember what it's called. Hardys? No. Harry's? No that's not it... Oh yeah, I remember... Harrods!

**_Gideon_** : You want me to buy Harrods!?!?!

**_Candice_** : Oh babes, would you? Oh I'm so excited, this nail bar idea of mine, it's gonna be massive. I'll be the queen of nail bars. I'll be in all the papers, Candice Jones, entrebr.. entrerpor.. enterer... business-woman. Can we make an offer now, I've got the phone number here, ring them now Gideon, I could have the interior designers in by the weekend...

**_Gideon_** : But Candice, I'm busy trying to rescue my portfolio...

- Candice looks like she's about to burst into tears

SONG: Under Pressure Under Pressure Part 1

**_Candice_** : But you promised I could open a nail bar! You know it's my dream.

**_Gideon_** : Candice, the markets... I'm almost broke

**_Candice_** : What about your relatives, I thought your Mum's uncle was royalty or something?

**_Gideon_** : Great Uncle Clive? But I don't even know the geezer, he'd never lend me money... Would he?

**_Candice_** : You're family Gid, he'd have to help out, you'd just have to work on him, like you worked on me... you've always had a way with words... tell him we've got a business opportunity he'd be crazy not to invest in.

**_Gideon_** : It sounds a bit like fraud to me.

SONG: Under Pressure Under Pressure Part 2

# Lord Naff Passes On

- Lord Naff is in bed

**_Lord Naff_** : Freddie... Freddie... Where's Freddie?

- Freddie enters

**_Freddie_** : Just coming Lord Naff. How are you feeling?

**_Lord Naff_** : I'm feeling tired Freddie.

**_Freddie_** : Well you are 123 sir. Should I pour your nightcap?

**_Lord Naff_** : That would be most kind. Easy on the absynth Freddie... I fear it affects my dreams.

- Freddie mixes his drink and passes it to him
- Lord Naff necks it

**_Freddie_** : One more your lordship?

**_Lord Naff_** : No no no! Well maybe just one. A little larger this time?

- Freddie goes back to the drinks trolley
- Mrs Buttermuffin enters carrying a basket with a teacloth covering

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : How's my favourite lord of the manor this evening?

**_Lord Naff_** : All the better for seeing your lovely baps Mrs Buttermuffin.

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Well they're not all for you. I've made sandwiches for Freddie and Gerald too.

- She places two large oven-bottom-muffins on the bedside table
- Freddie delivers the second nightcap, this time in a pint glass
- Lord Naff drinks it eagerly, then coughs violently and falls limply as if dead

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Freddie! Oh my, you've killed him, I told you not to give him spirits after 9 o'clock. Oh it's awful, Lord Naff, dead, look, he hasn't even touched my baps!

**_Freddie_** : Mamma, just killed a man, put a drink beside his bed, he had a swig and now he's dead. Mamma, life had just begun but now I've gone and thrown it all away.

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Freddie, this is no time for your silly songs! Oh your lordship, what a shock. He'd only just turned 123... had his whole life ahead of him. And now, he's gone.

- Lord Naff sits back up abruptly

**_Lord Naff_** : No, no, I'm not gone, just resting my eyes. Building up the strength to face these whoppers.

- He picks up a sandwich and takes a bite

**_Lord Naff_** :  I really don't know what I'd do without you two. You're both so good to me, as were your parents before you, and grandparents before them. Your families have looked after the Naffs for as long as anyone can remember. I'm so sorry for the way things have turned out.

**_Freddie_** : No need to apologise, your lordship. It has been an honour.

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : An absolute pleasure dear.

**_Lord Naff_** : But I have no heirs, no-one to hand things over to. I fear that when I'm gone, you will be without employment. Without a home. Without hope. That is why I have decided to leave everything I own, including Naff Hall, to you two. It really is the least I can do.

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Oh your lordship...

**_Freddie_** : That's extremely kind of you sir...

**_Lord Naff_** : I've instructed my solicitors, Barclay and Barclay to draw up the necessary papers.

- Outside a car screeches to a halt, sounds of brakes, gravel and a narrowly missed cat

**_Lord Naff_** : I expect that will be Barclay and Barclay arriving now with all the legal documents.

- Gideon bursts in

**_Gideon_** : Uncle! I came as fast as the Capri would get me here

- Trying not to let anyone notice, he places a photograph of himself on the bedside table

**_Lord Naff_** : Who are you?

- Gideon points at the photo

**_Gideon_** : Oh Uncle, you are a rascal, it's me, your favourite nephew, Gideon.

**_Lord Naff_** : Gideon!? Marjorie's lad, the malingering neer-do-well? The good-for-nothing work-shy slouch? The treacherous two-faced con-man?

**_Gideon_** : Woah woah, that's a bit strong guv.

- He swipes a large gold candlestick from the table and attempts to hide it behind his back

**_Lord Naff_** : A bit strong? You were sent to prison for theft and forgery. Your mother was heartbroken, she never recovered. You're a disgrace boy.

**_Gideon_** : Well I've always been very fond of YOU!

**_Lord Naff_** : No you haven't. You've never once even visited me.

**_Gideon_** : Well I'm here now, aren't I, ready to accept my inheritance

**_Lord Naff_** : Inheritance!?! Inheritance!!! You've as much chance of inheriting Naff Hall as I have of beating Boris Becker at Pickleball

- Candice enters

**_Candice_** : Gideon, how long are you gonna be babe? I hate it here, it's damp and it smells... You promised to take me shopping. Is he giving you the money?

- Gideon drops the candlestick he's nicked
- Candice spots it and bends over to pick it up giving Lord Naff an eyeful of her behind
- Lord Naff screams, chokes then falls back presumably dead

# Breaking News - Lord Naff is Dead

(Front of curtain)

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Our main story tonight - the sudden death of 123 year old Lord Naff. The shocking news was received just moments ago. Lord Naff was in excellent health and was due to take part in the Shutlingsloe fell race next week. A morning of mourning will take place in the morning. Elsewhere, another pothole has opened up on the main road. The shape of this latest pothole bears a remarkable similarity to Rod Stewart. We asked the Council if they intend to fill the pothole but they declined to comment. However, insiders say they are considering charging visitors to look at it. Now let's get the weather forecast from Stormy Spaniels. 

**_Stormy Spaniels_** : Thanks Roxy. Well if you ARE thinking of visiting the Rod Stewart pothole over the weekend, do bring a brolly as it might rain... But also it might not... We don't really know. Back to you Roxy.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Erm, thanks Stormy. Back to the breaking news and people are already starting to arrive for the funeral of Lord Naff who has died suddenly at the age of 123. We'll try to grab a few words from some of them, excuse me, how well did you know Lord Naff?

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Oh we worked for him our whole lives, it's so sad, taken too soon, I can't even....

- She blubs ridiculously

**_Freddie_** : It really is very upsetting, he never got round to his third nightcap. Come on now Mrs B, let's get you into the church... I'm sorry, we really must move on...

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : I appreciate you speaking to us at this upsetting time, sir! Excuse me sir. Can I have a few words Mr??

**_Gerald_** : Gerald!

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : And what did Lord Naff mean to you, Gerald?

**_Gerald_** : Well, ee, you see, iz wassname n then wen I arskd to go to the old sparsnaar with 'orses and whatnot well eee gives it Marmite you see and tells me to fix the crankletanker and anyhow eee had em playing Twister, ha!

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Indeed, thank you Gerald, clearly a very important figure in your life. Sir, a few words if I may? Did you work for Lord Naff?

**_Gideon_** : Work? Cor blimey no! I'm Gideon, his nephew... and only heir. Oh we had a terrific relationship, I was always visiting and helping out especially as he got old, you know? I mean I probably did TOO much for him, but you know, I had to cos of how much I loved him n that

**_Candice_** : Yeah Gideon was always goin' on about him. Uncle Naff this and Uncle Naff that, it got a bit annoying to be honest but...

- Gideon nudges her to shut up

**_Candice_** : But, yeah, I didn't mind cos he's got a load of cash.. I mean a lovely house.. I mean he was a lovely kind man.

**_Gideon_** : Look we're in a hurry, we need to send him off before we get to the good bit. As the new Lord Naff, I've got plans... Big plans. I'll be making a statement later.

- They go into "the church"

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Well there you have it. A day of sadness and turmoil for the people of Wildboarclough. Clive Ignatious Maximillian Naff, a man who did so much for this village. He will be sorely missed.

# Funeral

- Church organ music is playing

**_Vicar_** : Welcome everyone to this sad occasion as we bid farewell to Clive Ignatious Maximillian Naff. He was born in 1862, a very different time, long before the invention of the filofax or the video-recorder. A popular man, always treating those below him with dignity and kindness. He cared for those less fortunate than himself, even if they were dirty and smelly. Most of all, he was a well liked employer, looking after those who looked after him, Freddie his butler, Mrs Buttermuffin the housekeeper, Mrs Tripps the tea lady, Geraldine who looked after his horses and of course Gerald who was his... well no-one seems sure, but we shall hear a few words now from Gerald.

**_Gerald_** : NONSENSE_GOES_HERE

**_Vicar_** : Have you finished? You have? Oh, right, well thank you Gerald, I'm sure we all found that very moving. Now Geraldine has written a poem which she hopes will help us all on this sad day, Geraldine...

**_Geraldine_** : GERALDINES_POEM

**_Vicar_** : Thank you Geraldine. We will now join together and sing Lord Naff's favourite song which you will find on the back of your order of service.

- Organ music starts

All: Are you going to take me home tonight. Ahhh down beside that red fire light. Are you gonna let it all hang out, Fat Bottomed Girls you make the rockin world go round. 

- Gideon turns off the organ?

**_Gideon_** : Right, I think we've all had enough of this.  We need to move on, there's a new Lord in town, and I've got plans... Big plans! Vicar, let's wrap up so we can get back for the will reading.

- Ghost of Lord Naff drifts in, begins to try speaking to the others, waving his hand in their faces etc
- He points at the coffin

**_Lord Naff_** : Who's in there? I say, Freddie, what's going on. Freddie, why are you ignoring me? Mrs B, why won't anyone speak to me?

- Old Lord Naff drifts in
- He clicks his fingers and all the "living" freeze

**_Old Lord Naff_** : You're a ghost my boy. They can't see you. They can't hear you. THEY can't even smell you.

**_Lord Naff_** : Smell me? Oh... I'd just had a bite of Mrs Buttermuffin's oven-bottom bap, I think it had garlic sausage on... What do you mean "I'm a ghost"?

**_Old Lord Naff_** : You're dead.

**_Lord Naff_** : Nonsense, I've never felt better.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : You have ceased to be, passed on, bereft of life you rest in peace, you've kicked the bucket, shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible.

**_Lord Naff_** : I can't believe it, I'm only 123.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Count yourself lucky, I didn't make it to 50, measles got me.

**_Lord Naff_** : I'm sorry, I don't think we've been introduced. You are...?

**_Old Lord Naff_** : I'm your great great great great grandfather, Lord Naff. Don't you recognise me from the paintings?

**_Lord Naff_** : Paintings? Oh, the big ones in the dining room. I'm afraid we took those down years ago. They were putting me off my Cocoa Pops... Not nice at all.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Mmmmm... Well I suppose we'd better let these people get on with seeing you off. Come along, you can meet the others.

- He clicks his fingers, the service concludes as the curtains close, leaving the two Naffs in front.

- Lord Naff and Old Lord Naff are already FOC
- Norman walks up the aisle

**_Norman_** : Well take me to the top of me Mam's staircase... It's you, you're finally here.

**_Lord Naff_** : I'm sorry I don't think we've met...

**_Norman_** : Oh, we've met alright fella. We've met alright.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Might I introduce you to Norman. Norman is a conjurer of magic and great wonderment, a harnesser of forces beyond your imagination, a bringer-of-light, a god in man's clothing, a... a...

**_Lord Naff_** : Oh, you're the electrician. Good lord, I haven't seen you since you were rewiring the Hall. How are you?

**_Norman_** : I'm dead mate!

**_Lord Naff_** : Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you mind my asking, how, I mean when, I mean...

**_Norman_** : YOU KILLED ME, you great stuck up sack of lard

**_Lord Naff_** : I killed you? I have no idea what you're talking about. You were rewiring the basement, then you just never came back. Have you any idea how hard it was to find another electrical contractor to finish YOUR job?

**_Norman_** : Let me jog your memory. It was a gloomy Monday afternoon back in 1974. I was working in the basement. I'd removed the big fuse, I was just about to reconnect the new wiring, I was up me step ladder, I took me screwdriver and bang! Lights out.

**_Lord Naff_** : The lights went out?  Do you know why?

**_Norman_** : No mate, Me!!! Zapped me shoes, frazzled me flares, melted me denim jacket, game over. SOMEONE had put the big fuse back in...

**_Lord Naff_** : Had they?... oh... ah... well I can explain you see, I remember now, yes, yes I think I can remember, Monday afternoon did you say, yes, well you see, I was about to settle down and watch Sale Of The Century, have you seen it? Oh it's very good... "And Now, From Norwich, It's The Quiz of The Week" ha!... anyway, so I tried to switch on the tellybox but it wasn't working so I went to see what was going on, and that's when I noticed the fuse had been removed from the, the thingy, with all the wires... So I put it back in.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : And then what happened?

**_Lord Naff_** : Well there was a gentleman from Aldershot, he got a teasmade, a speedboat and a set of golf clubs, though lord knows why he'd want those, no one normal likes.......

**_Old Lord Naff_** : I MEAN, what happened to Norman here?

**_Lord Naff_** : Oh, I, err, well, I'm not_

**_Norman_** : Well isn't it obvious? There was a massive spark, then I sparked out.

**_Lord Naff_** : Oh dear, that is rather unfortunate.

**_Hildegaard_** : Well hello. Who you are please?

**_Old Lord Naff_** : This is the newest Lord Naff, he's just passed on

**_Hildegaard_** : Handsome AND a Lord? Very happy this is making me! Queen Hildegaard of Hockflugenstein at your service I am being. If you are needing anything...and I MEAN anything...

**_Lord Naff_** : Queen Hildegaard? THE Queen Hildegaard. Feared across the lands of The North, ruler of the Sweinstein Empire, undefeated in battle, The Killer Queen???

**_Hildegaard_** : Oh, I'm quite nice, when you get to know me.

**_Norman_** : Hilda, Hilda, I err, I fixed your hairdryer, you know, the one you were having trouble with like...

**_Hildegaard_** : What? Oh, good morning Norman, I am not noticing you, oh my dryhairer, yes, thank you. Now then Lord Naff, you must be joining me for dinner this evening, I insist. We have herring. Come, you may walk with me, we shall be knowing each other.

- Hildegaard and Lord Naff leave down the aisle
- Norman shouts after them

**_Norman_** : Shall I join you for dinner Hilda? Hilda? I like herring... She can't hear me.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : I don't think she WANTs to hear you dear boy. I think she's more interested in the young Lord

**_Norman_** : He's doin' my head in that one. First he kills me, now he's nicked me bird, I've had it up to here with him.

- Norman storms off down the aisle

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Norman, Norman, wait for me... I was hoping I could borrow that hairdryer.

- Old LN follows down the aisle

# In The Kitchen

(Cardboard oven, smoke, at end, PPE to remove it, put onto trolley, wheeled FOC)

**_Freddie_** : Oh, the house seems so quiet now Lord Naff has gone. I don't know what I'll do next. I never really chose to be a butler, it just ran in the family. I always liked the idea of being a rock star, but I think I'm probably too old for that kind of thing now. Everyone says I should settle down with someone nice and stop dreaming, but I've never met the right person...

- Mrs Buttermuffin marches in, and looks annoyed at Freddie talking to himself

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Come along Freddie, never mind all this chit-chattering. I need you to help me bake one of my cakes.

**_Freddie_** : You're going to bake one of your cakes?

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Well of course I'm going to bake a cake. My cakes are fabulous, now you can help me with the ingredients. Eggs... thank you, flour... butter... jam... sausages... 

**_Freddie_** : Mrs B, are you sure you want to go to all this trouble, I mean, what if no one is in the mood for cake.

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Not in the mood for cake. Who on earth wouldn't be in the mood for a slice of my delicious cake? Now, tabasco sauce, sugar, 2 tins of tuna... Freddie, would you go and turn the mixer on...

- Freddie goes off stage
- We hear the sound of a cement mixer starting up
- Mrs B shouts to Freddie

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : 3 buckets of sugar, one of cement Freddie.

- We hear stuff being thrown into the mixer and a slop, slop sound

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Now then, will minced beef make it a bit too rich? Oh why not, life's too short. Oh! I nearly forgot... cream. Mrs Tripps, would you fetch some cream?

- Mrs Tripps shuffles off
- Candice arrives

**_Candice_** : Hiya babes, Gid sent me to make sure you doin' all the food right and whatnot, he... Woah! Where d'ya get your eyebrows done babe? They are a-maze-ing

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : My eye...? I, I, don't know what you mean...

**_Candice_** : Oh babes, they are the best-est. Gideon's said I can open a salon here once he's inherited the hall, and I am TOTALLY gonna do those brows at my new place.

- Freddie returns carrying heavy builders buckets

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Gideon, inheriting...? Oh, dear, I'm afraid Lord Naff has bequeathed everything to Me and Freddie. Everything. Oh I'm so sorry love, I'm afraid you've had a wasted journey.

**_Candice_** : He left it all to you two???!!!

**_Freddie_** : He did, I'm very sorry

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Still, at least stay for a bit of cake

- Candice looks flustered

**_Candice_** : I need, I need.. to speak to Gideon... I have to...

- Candice turns to leave, and as she does runs straight into a big plate of cream which Mrs Tripps is carrying in

**_Gideon_** : The old fool has left everything to his useless old staff. I know. I know. Don't worry, you'll get your money, I just need a bit more time... There's no need to threaten me George, it'll all work out, I promise

- Gideon finishes his call
- Barclay and Barclay arrive
- Gideon attempts to conceal the fake will behind his back

**_Gideon_** : Ah, gentlemen, Barclay and Barclay I presume?

**_Barclay One_** : Yes

**_Barclay Two_** : And you are???

**_Gideon_** : Oh, my apologies, Gideon Goldgrabber, entrepreneur, philanthropist and err... grieving nephew.

**_Barclay One_** : Oh dear

**_Barclay Two_** : Our condolences

**_Gideon_** : Oh yeah, he was a dear, dear uncle, I will miss him so... he always had such beautiful... handwriting

**_Barclay One_** : Beautiful

**_Barclay Two_** : Hand... writing...?

**_Gideon_** : If I could just see his handwriting, one last time, it would mean so much to me... is THAT his will? Oh could I just have a quick butchers?

**_Barclay One_** : Quick butchers?

**_Barclay Two_** : It's highly irregular

- They look at Gideon, then at each other, then back at Gideon

**_Barclay One_** : We don't see why not

- They pass him the file containing the will
- Gideon takes a quick look and begins ooh-ing and ahh-ing about the handwriting

**_Gideon_** : Oh, yeah, that's the stuff, beautiful handwriting... wait... is that a Lesser-Spotted Wincle-Warbler?

- He points offstage
- Barclay and Barclay pull binoculars from the briefcases and frantically try to look
- Gideon pulls out the fake will and switches it with the real one

**_Barclay One_** : Can you see a Wincle-Warbler

- He passes back the file containing the fake will
- They both look at Gideon with suspicion, but are not sure what just happened

**_Barclay One_** : Mmm, very quick

**_Barclay Two_** : They don't like being spotted

**_Gideon_** : Anyway, I'd best let you gentlemen get on with things, I suppose you charge by the hour? Ha. In you go... that will ain't gonna read itself.

- The curtains open
- Mrs Tripps wheels the cake in
- Freddie and Mrs Buttermuffin enter, loudly chattering
- Gideon sees them, looks at the real will he's holding, looks around for somewhere to hide it, and as the only resort, shoves it in the cake

---

# Will Reading

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Would either of you gentlemen like a slice of cake

- Barclay and Barclay both look at the cake, then at each other, then at Mrs Buttermuffin

**_Barclay One_** : Well we really shouldn't

**_Barclay Two_** : Trying to stay in trim

**_Barclay One_** : But on THIS occasion

**_Barclay Two_** : It would be rude not to...

- Gideon panics, steps in and interrupts

**_Gideon_** : Nah, it's too early for cake. These gentlemen charge by the hour. We really need to get on with the formalities.

- He ushers them to open the will

**_Barclay One_** : Oh, how disappointing

- Barclay Two clears his throat and begins to address the others

**_Barclay Two_** : We're here today to read the last will and testament of Lord Naff.

**_Barclay One_** : I would have liked some cake!

**_Barclay Two_** : Cecil..! The will please!

- Barclay One takes the will from his briefcase and looks at it

**_Barclay One_** : This handwriting is terrible

- He passes it to Barclay Two who begins to read it out loudly

**_Barclay Two_** : Never mind that Cecil, we're not here to admire his handwriting. Let me read... oh, I see. My glasses please Cecil

- Barclay one, hands reading glasses to Barclay Two

**_Barclay Two_** : That's slightly better. "I, Lord Naff, would like to thank my nephew Gideon, who's really great and has lovely hair, for always looking after me. Gideon is dead kind and thoughtful"

**_Barclay One_** : He hasn't spelled that correctly at all!

**_Barclay Two_** : Mmm... "dead kind and thoughtful and his hair is always looking triffic"

**_Barclay One_** : What does "triffic" mean?

**_Barclay Two_** : I have no idea... "And so because he's so great and everything, I leave all my things including this big house to my nephew, Gideon"

**_Gideon_** : Oh uncle Naff, what an absolute gent.

**_Freddie_** : This can't be right

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : He told us that...

**_Barclay One_** : Shhhh! We haven't finished.

**_Barclay Two_** : "I mustn't forget the guy with the teeth and the big bird in the dress..."

**_Freddie_** : Oh, this is us...

- Gideon produces the photo of himself and hands it to them

**_Gideon_** : Oh, ain't that nice of him, you see, he didn't forget you, what an absolute gent. Well that's all done and dusted then. Thank you gentlemen, don't want to keep you any longer than necessary.

**_Barclay One_** : But we were promised cake

**_Gideon_** : Come along now, I know you charge by the hour...

**_Barclay Two_** : Oh, how disappointing!

- They are ushered out by Gideon
- Ghost Lord Naff enters

**_Freddie_** : This doesn't seem right, does it?

- Lord Naff addresses the audience

**_Lord Naff_** : Can you hear me? Do you understand what's going on? No? Well you need to concentrate, honestly, the script gets even harder to follow in a bit...

- Mrs Tripps shuffles in with a tea tray

**_Gideon_** : Right, well, as the new Lord Naff I've got some big plans. Things are going to change around here. I'm going to shake things up.

**_Tripps_** : A cup of tea your lordship?

**_Gideon_** : Milk, four sugars... And you are?

**_Tripps_** : Mrs Tripps your lordship

**_Gideon_** : And how long have you been with us Mrs Tripps?

**_Tripps_** : Oh, let me think, oh as long as I can remember, now, let me think, I was 16 when I started, I'm 86 now, so that's, oh, dear, now don't rush me, I'd have been 26 after 10 years, and after 20 years I'd have been 36, and then, oh hang on, what did I get to...

**_Gideon_** : I think you've been here long enough... You're fired!

- Mrs Tripps is shocked and upset, she shuffles slowly offstage with her tea tray

**_Gideon_** : As I said, things are gonna change round here, I've got plans... Big plans

His fiancee, Candice Jones is expected to be given the title of Lady Naff. Reactions to the news have been mixed.

**_Stormy Spaniels_** : Thanks Roxy. Well, it's going to be a lovely day if you're a Scorpio, a Leo or a Gemini with temperatures expected to reach 25 degrees. However if you're a Pisces then there's a high chance of snow later in the day. Capricorns can expect to meet a tall dark stranger but it's bad news if you're Libra, or Asparagus.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Every week we hold a talent show. We call it Ex Factor because, well, you know we're all "Ex-animis"

**_Lord Naff_** : Ex-what-a-what?

**_Old Lord Naff_** : It's latin, dear boy, lifeless, departed, expired. No wonder you've no heirs, in my day, the ladies loved a bit of latin. Anyway, the talent show... We wondered if you'd take part?

**_Lord Naff_** : Oh, I don't think so, I'm not really very talented.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Good heavens, we don't want you to perform! You see every week we end up in a big argument over which of us was best. It can get rather unpleasant, last week Queen Hildegaard threatened to cut off my arms, which would have made carrying my head rather awkward!! Ha! Anyway, we were wondering if you would be kind enough to be an impartial judge. You can decide who wins. 

**_Lord Naff_** : Well I don't really think it's a____

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Excellent, that's settled then. Now our first act will be Queen Hildegaard of Hockflugenstein, singing a wonderful little operetta...

- Hildegaard sings Killer Queen?!?
- Flirts with Lord Naff?

**_Hildegaard_** : Well, what the verdict is? Is it the winner I am?

**_Lord Naff_** : Well I have to see the other acts first.

**_Hildegaard_** : You don't need to be seeing anything. I show you everything you need to be seeing.

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Now come on Hilda, stop trying to influence the judge. You need to let me do my standup comedy routine now...

- OLN does some jokes

**_Norman_** : Right, stop! Some of these jokes are older than you are Time for my magic show.

- Norman does a bad magic routine?

- Freddie wanders in, obviously can't see the ghosts, but starts talking to the audience

**_Freddie_** : I still haven't found that special someone. I really am so lonely. Stuck here with no companionship. I mean, there's Mrs Buttermuffin, but that's not the same. I mean I think of her as one of the boys really, I don't know why, I just always have... Oh I'm so lonely... I'm more lonely than that.

- SONG: Somebody to Love (Ghosts provide backing vocals?)

**_Lord Naff_** : Well I think we have a winner, full marks Freddie.

- Other ghosts start arguing with him that a non-ghost can't take part, let alone win, Ex Factor
- Curtains?

# Newsnight - Gideon Reveals Plans

(FOC)

- Newsnight theme tune

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Tonight, on Newsnight, we're joined by the new Lord Naff after dramatic scenes at Naff Hall. We'll be discussing his plans for the future and we'll be asking local politician Dr Chris O'Really what these plans might mean for the local economy. And given the popularity of the Rod Stewart Pothole, we'll be reporting on a new scheme to open up more potholes around the area. But first, I'm joined by Gideon Goldgrabber, the new Lord Naff.

**_Gideon_** : Good evening Roxy, it's a pleasure to be here.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : You released a statement earlier saying you had "Big Plans". Perhaps you could explain these big plans in more detail?

**_Gideon_** : Of course. Well I'm delighted to say that I shall be digging up the entire Naff Hall estate and reshaping it into an exclusive golf course.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : How would you respond to critics who say that most normal people don't like golf?

**_Gideon_** : Well it's not for them. Membership will only be offered to the very very wealthy, and I've already had interest from some very high profile posho's. You see, it only needs a few very rich old blokes to make ME a very rich young bloke, do you see. It's a win win.

- We see Chris appear at the side of the curtains

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Mmm, well we're able to speak now with Chris O'Really, via video link from his, err, yacht? Thanks for taking the time to speak to us, I know you're incredibly busy.

**_Chris O'Really_** : Good evening Roxy, no problem at all, always doing what I can for my constituents.

- Someone passes him a cocktail. He takes a sip

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : These golf course proposals have been somewhat controversial. Will they be allowed to go ahead.

**_Chris O'Really_** : I don't see why not. I think it will be good for the local economy. We've seen how tourism can give the area a boost - you only have to look at the success of the Rod Stewart Pothole to see what a lift THAT has given us. So yes, I think this golf course will be a good thing and I've been assured that the environmental impact will be negligible. We just need to do the appropriate due diligence.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Well it seems that Wildboarclough will be getting a new exclusive golf course. Dr Chris O'Really, Gideon Goldgr.. I mean Lord Naff, thanks both of you for joining us tonight.

- Gideon and Chris both "leave"

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : And finally with news of a troubling weather outlook, here's Stormy Spaniels.

**_Stormy Spaniels_** : Thanks Roxy, yes, well, Storm Maggie has been moving across the Atlantic over the past 24 hours and is due to hit the UK tomorrow afternoon. It might reach Wildboarclough later that evening... or it might not.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Thanks Stormy, well that's all for tonight, just a quick look at tomorrow's papers.

- She picks up a few newspapers, and one-by-one, shows them to the audience
- She then goes back through the curtain

# Mrs Dripps is Fired

- Mrs Buttermuffin and Mrs Tripps are on stage, looking around nervously
- Mrs B gives Mrs T a pair of glasses which she puts on
- Mrs B then gives Mrs T a feather duster

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : There, Mrs Tripps, you're now Mrs Dripps, the cleaning lady. A perfect disguise.

**_Tripps_** : Are you sure he won't recognise me?

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Of course not, he's too wrapped up in his own self-importance to notice anyone else. Oh... Shhh, he's coming, good luck

- She rushes off
- Gideon walks on

**_Gideon_** : What's this? Who are you? 

**_Tripps_** : Oh, I'm Mrs Dripps, the cleaning lady

**_Gideon_** :  Cleaning lady? Why have I never seen you before?

**_Tripps_** : I, err, I usually work nights

**_Gideon_** : You look familiar, have you been on the telly?

**_Tripps_** : Oh, no, nothing like that sir. I just stick to my cleaning.

- Gideon runs his finger across a surface and inspects the dust

**_Gideon_** : Mmmm, you don't seem to be very good at it. How much am I paying you for this?

**_Tripps_** : Oh, well, I err, I'm not really sure you see, I used to get paid three and six a day, but that was when I first started for the old Lord Naff, and then, let me think....

**_Gideon_** : Never mind, you don't need to think about it any more... You're fired!

- Mrs Dripps bursts into tears and rushes out
- Freddie rushes in

**_Freddie_** : You can't fire Mrs Dripps. Who'll do all the cleaning?

**_Gideon_** : Well you don't seem to do an awful lot round here...

- He picks up the feather duster, thrusts it at Freddie

**_Gideon_** : you can do it

- Gideon storms out
- Freddie calls out after him

**_Freddie_** : But I've nothing to wear, I can't do the cleaning dressed like this, it's not dignified

- Mrs Buttermuffin rushes on

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Have you heard, it's awful

**_Freddie_** : I know, he's fired Mrs Dripps and made ME the cleaning lady

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Not that, we'll find Mrs Dripps a new job somewhere round here... It's all over the news. Gideon is going to turn the gardens into a luxury golf-course

**_Freddie_** : But nobody normal likes golf.

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : I know, oh it's awful, just think of the type of person it'll bring here.

**_Freddie_** : Pompous men with moustaches, dressed up in silly clothing, oh this is a disaster darling.

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Our Lord Naff would never have done something like this. We have to stop this golf course.

# Penguins

- Gideon is showing Chris O'Really around the grounds describing his plans for the golf course. Freddie is accompanying them.

**_Gideon_** : And this will be the 18th hole, and we'll dig a bunker there and...

- Barclay and Barclay wander in with binoculars in hand

**_Gideon_** :  What are you two doing here?

**_Barclay One_** : Haven't you heard? Apparently there is a rare species of bird nesting here.

**_Barclay Two_** : It's very exciting.

**_Gideon_** : Rare species of bird?

**_Tripps_** : Good morning, isn't this wonderful? You're very lucky, they're incredibly rare.

**_Gideon_** : What are? Who are you? What's going on? Freddie... what's this geezer doin' on my land?

**_Freddie_** : Oh, he's the bird expert sir, it's all part of the planning application, you have to have a bird inspection, isn't that right Mr O'Really

**_Chris O'Really_** : Oh, yes, that's, probably necessary, yes, very difficult for us to grant permission without a, "bird inspection", I suppose. Just a formality, I'm sure there's no need for you to worry...

**_Tripps_** : Well that's just it. You see I've found an extremely rare breed of birds which are nesting on the site. Extremely rare, especially around here.

**_Barclay One_** : Oh, how exciting!

**_Barclay Two_** : I wonder what they can be!

**_Barclay One_** : Peregrine falcons perhaps?

**_Barclay Two_** : Or white-tailed eagles maybe?

- Gerald and Geraldine waddle on dressed as penguins
- 
**_Barclay One_** : Or... Penguins!?!?!

**_Gideon_** : Penguins???!!!

**_Freddie_** : Penguins?

**_Tripps_** : It was all they had at the fancy dress shop. I got a good deal, hire one, get the second one free.

**_Chris O'Really_** : Well I'm afraid if there are penguins nesting here then I have to declare this a site of special scientific interest. I won't be able to approve any changes to the grounds.

**_Gideon_** : Not even a golf course?

**_Chris O'Really_** : Especially, not a golf course!

# News Update - Super Prison

(FOC)

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Plans to build Wildboarclough's first luxury golf course have been refused after rare penguins were discovered nesting in the area. Councillor Chris O'Really has declared it a site of special scientific interest. Bird-watchers have been flocking into the village. We'll speak now to Gideon Goldgrabber, the man behind the golf course plans. Mr Goldgrabber, are you angry that the golf course has been stopped.

**_Gideon_** : Angry, course I'm angry darlin'. I was gonna be rich, very rich, and now I find out I've got an infestation... of penguins.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Indeed, are you considering a planning appeal.

**_Gideon_** : No need darlin, I've already come up with a better idea. As I'm sure you know, crime is on the rise, the news is full of it, and the government is getting tough, locking em up, throwing away the key, that sort of thing. So, it's a real growth area, and I'm getting in to it.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : You're taking up crime?

**_Gideon_** : Nah darlin, prisons, prisons are a growth area. I'm gonna knock down Naff Hall and build an 84 story super-prison on the footprint. The government'll pay me for every criminal I take. And best of all, super-criminals aren't allowed outside, so I don't have to worry about no penguins.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Well there you have it. It looks like Wildboarclough will soon have its first "super-prison"

# Thwarting of the Super-Prison

- The ghosts are on stage

**_Lord Naff_** : They can't knock down my house

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Indeed, where will WE live?

**_Norman_** : What will happen to my rewiring... I'll have been electrocuted for nothing

**_Hildegaard_** : And I am NOT approving of the super-criminals.

**_Lord Naff_** : We have to do something

- Gideon and Chris O'Really enter

**_Chris O'Really_** : Well, the place isn't listed or anything and nothing of any historical interest ever happened here so...

**_Gideon_** : So I can knock it down and build my super-prison?

- Old Lord Naff causes time to freeze
- Norman makes the lights flicker and spark
- Hildegaard concentrates on a large book on a shelf, making it move and fall off
- Old Lord Naff unfreezes everything
- Chris notices this book on the floor and picks it up

**_Chris O'Really_** : I almost stepped on this... wait, these are official records from the olden days, how fascinating... it says here that the house was visited by Queen Hildegaard of Hockflugenstein on her "Campaign of Cruelty" tour - oh I'm a big fan of that one, that was at the height of her power, very notable... She stopped for a short break in order to make use of the facilities. The servants reported hearing a loud groaning sound from behind the latrine door... followed by such a creaking and splintering of the wooden platform therein... She fell with a huge splatter down into the dark filthiness below, and was lost forever.

**_Gideon_** : Yeah, very interesting, can we just get on with signing off my plans, so I can start making super-prison-cash?

**_Chris O'Really_** : I don't think you understand, this suggests that Queen Hildegaard fell down the toilet... and that she lost her life... here, in this very place... that is of the utmost historical importance, an incredible discovery, we'll need to speak to English Heritage right away

**_Gideon_** : Does this mean, what I think it means? You're not gonna let me build my super-prison are you?

**_Chris O'Really_** : Oh my dear Gideon, of course not. You can't demolish this place, it is of the utmost importance. Queen Hildegaard was an important figure in European history. Furthermore, this is the only recorded instance of a famous person meeting their end on the toilet.

- Elvis wanders in

Elvis : Can I just stop you there sir? You said the ONLY famous person to die on the toilet?

**_Gideon_** : Keith! Not now! Sorry, this is Keith our gardener, he hangs around in the shed, I haven't got round to firing him... Yet!

**_Chris O'Really_** : Well, there certainly seem to have been an awful lot of unusual things  taking place in Wildboarclough

Elvis : You can say that again, your holiness... take it away Freddie

(SONG: Crazy Things In Wildboarclough)

# Newsnight - Candice Announces Plans For Spa

(FOC)

- Newsnight theme
- Roxy and Candice are both sporting ridiculous dame-brows

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : After plans were rejected for his exclusive golf course, and for a potential super-prison, Lord Gideon Naff appears to have handed over responsibility for the future direction of Naff Hall to Lady Naff. She joins me in the studio now.

**_Candice_** : Hiya Roxy babes.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : I understand that you have been appointed head of ideas at Naff Hall.

**_Candice_** : Yeah, head of ideas babe, that's right, it's exciting. I'm really excited.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Can you tell us anything about your plans

**_Candice_** : Yeah, I'm gonna open a luxury spa, for the super-rich. It's gonna have a pool, and a sauna and I'll be doing makeovers.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Your plans will certainly raise eyebrows round here!

**_Candice_** : Exactly, raising eyebrows, raising bums, raising anything I can really.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Can I ask if you have any concerns about the local road problems. Will that not dissuade the super-rich from visiting your spa?

**_Candice_** : Oh no babes, it's not a problem. We're gonna put a helipad on the roof for the helicopters and that. And I'm gonna build a marina for their luxury super-yachts.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : A marina? Are you sure you can sail to Wildboarclough in a super-yacht?

**_Candice_** : Mmmm?? Sorry, wasn't listening, Super-yachts, yeah. And I'm gonna redecorate all the rooms, in my own unique style. Make it really tasteful babes. Leopardskin 'n that.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Well, there you have it, before we have a look at tomorrow's papers, a quick update on Storm Maggie.

- Stormy appears wearing a massive raincoat, hat, umbrella, sou-wester, etc?

**_Stormy Spaniels_** : It's coming!!!!!

- She disappears again

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Thanks Stormy

- Roxy holds up some more newspapers, lights down

- C O'R, Barclay and Barclay, Candice and Gideon enter from the other side
- Candice is explaining her plans for the spa, eyebrows, nails, botox, helicopters and massive yachts in the marina.
- C'OR is confused about the marina, but seems happy with the overall proposal, given that it won't impact the penguins and Naff Hall will remain

- "Ghosts" get scared and run off.

# Spa Rejection Fax

(FOC)

- Gideon receives a fax which he picks up and begins to read
- The fax is from Chris O'Really and we hear it being read out

**_Chris O'Really_** : Dear Gideon, with respect to my visit earlier today, I noted, with some concern, that Naff Hall appears to be haunted by two extremely frightening ghosts. Not that I myself was scared you understand. I have subsequently consulted the council's "Big Book Of Rules" and the following came to my attention. Regulation 17, paragraph b, subsection 3 states: "A spa cannot be opened in a building which is known, or thought to be, haunted". As I'm sure you will understand, it is with regret that I must decline your delightful fiancees plans for her luxury spa.

**_Gideon_** : Gaaahhhhhhh! Oh, what's this? P.S....

**_Chris O'Really_** : P.S. I did a little more research and discovered the following addendum... Should any and all ghost (or ghosts) be removed by a specialist and an authenticated certificate of exorcism can be produced, then permission would be given... permission would be given... perm...

- Chris's voice echoes away
- Candice enters and overhears

**_Gideon_** : An exorcism certificate? Right, I've no idea what one is, but I need to arrange an exorcism...

**_Candice_** : Oh I know someone who does that, she's really good

**_Gideon_** : Really? Well this was your idea in the first place, so here... you deal with it. I've got a loan shark called Big George who needs calming down.

- He shoves the phone and the fax into Candice's hands and storms off
- Candice makes a phone call

**_Candice_** : Hiya, is that Diane? It's Candice... Listen babes, I need you to do that thing again. Yeah, as soon as possible. Quick as you can. ASAP.

# The Exorcist

- Diane is at the front setting up a large ghetto-blaster
- The ghosts are also about to participate

**_Freddie_** : I thought he'd asked for an exorcism?

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : I think someone's made a mistake!

**_Diane_** : OK, everyone, let's start with something to warm us all up shall we.

- She presses play on her ghetto blaster and some loud 80's music blares out
- Everyone starts to do various levels of star jumps, bends and stretches

**_Diane_** : That's it Freddie love, work those triceps, come on Mrs B, I know you can give me more...

- Gideon storms on, having been disturbed by the loud music
- He hits the stop button and the music dies

**_Gideon_** : What the 'ell's all this. I needed an exorcism doing and I'm pretty sure this isn't it.

**_Diane_** : Oh... an EXORCISM. Sorry love Candy over there said you wanted exercise-ism, didn't you love?

**_Candice_** : I did babes, yeah, sorry

**_Gideon_** :  Well I'm not paying for this!

**_Diane_** : Well just hold on a minute, anyone who knows me knows I'm one thing more than anything. I'm resourceful, isn't that right Candy? See, she knows. Now let me think. Exorcism... well, I've seen the film, oh what's it called, the one with the man who does the exorcisms in it? Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue, the film, oh it really scared the willies out of me I can tell you.

**_Freddie_** : The Exorcist?

**_Diane_** : Mmmm, no, I don't think that was it... Oh, it'll come to me when I'm least expecting it. Anyway, I've seen the film, I can remember what he did, that man, he was a priest I think, anyway, I saw what he did, and to be honest, it didn't look difficult. I'll need some candles. I've got some for the yoga classes I do, they're in the Punto, I won't be a mo...

- She leaves and we hear the sound of the storm reaching its peak

**_Gideon_** : Right you two, haven't you got contracts to read through or something? Hop it.

- Barclay and Barclay leave

**_Gideon_** : And I don't pay you to take dance classes all day - back to work.

- Freddie and Mrs Buttermuffin leave
- Candice is the only one left (apart from the ghosts)
- Gideon turns to leave and as he does so...

**_Gideon_** : Candice... a word in my office please!

- Offstage there is a flash and a thunderclap, followed by a sizzling noise
- Diane returns, her face slightly sooty and her hair huge and frizzly

**_Diane_** : I've just remembered... Ghostbusters!

- She sees the ghosts

**_Diane_** : Oh hello, have you just arrived? Oh, are you here for aerobics? I'm sorry, it's been cancelled.

**_Hildegaard_** : You can see us?

**_Diane_** : Yes?!?

**_Norman_** : All of us?

**_Diane_** : Yes, I can see ALL of you

**_Old Lord Naff_** : Even me?

**_Diane_** : Look, I don't know whether you think I'm daft or something but I've an exorcism that needs doing. So if you want to make yourselves useful you can help me lay out these candles. I need them in the shape of a pentagram. It's like a five pointed star kind of thingy.

- The ghosts huddle together and whisper excitedly to each other

**_Lord Naff_** : Well my dear. I think you may be exactly who we need.

**_Stormy Spaniels_** : Well I certainly didn't see that coming

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Aren't you supposed to forecast the weather

**_Stormy Spaniels_** : I'm not Mystic Meg

# Seance

- Diane has now embellished her outfit, gypsy headscarf etc.
- F&MBM, B&B, Mrs Tripps, Gerald and Geraldine are all gathered round
- B&B cite legal precedents which mean that they cannot do anything without proof.
- Need to set a trap - tell Gideon that tomorrow the cake is going to be cut up and handed out to the poor in Sutton/Wincle/Langley (they'll eat anything, that lot), but in the meantime it'll be left in the pantry.

**_Diane_** : I'm connected to the spirit world, but the signal is not good, the message is unclear, I'm getting the name Barry, is there a Barry here? No? Harry maybe? Larry? Carry?

- Everyone looks out into the audience and confirms there IS a Carry here

**_Diane_** : Oh, Carry love, apparently your monster truck is blocking everyone in dear... You'll need to move it.

**_Lord Naff_** : The will's fake

**_Old Lord Naff_** : The will

**_Norman_** : It's in the cake

**_Hildegaard_** : The will's in the cake

**_Diane_** : Something about Will and Kate. Does anyone know Will and Kate?

- Everyone looks at each other and shrugs

**_Diane_** : I think the spirits are angry

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Oh dear, angry spirits, that's not good

- The ghosts are pointing at the cake and miming "eating"

**_Diane_** : Oh, sorry, not angry, hungry. Oh... I think they want cake.

**_Freddie_** : They're welcome to it

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : How dare you, everyone loves my cake

**_Tripps_** : Hold on, Will, Cake...

- Tripps, Buttermuffin and Freddie all look at each other

**_Freddie_** : The will's in the cake
**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : The will's in the cake
**_Tripps_** : The will's in the cake

- Freddie reaches into the cake and pulls out the will
- He brushes it clean and hands it to Mrs BM who reads it out

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : I hereby leave everything to Freddie and Mrs Buttermuffin, my faithful servants, and friends... Oh my!

**_Freddie_** : Well, this proves it. This is the real will, the other one is a fake.

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Gideon must have switched them.

**_Tripps_** : You have to do something.

**_Barclay One_** : It's not that simple I'm afraid

**_Barclay Two_** : Legal precedents

**_Barclay One_** : Very complex

**_Barclay Two_** : We need proof that Gideon hid the real will

**_Freddie_** : How do we prove that?

**_Tripps_** :  We need to set a trap

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** :  Catch him red handed

# News - Cake For The Needy

(FOC)

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : ...And finally, a local Wildboarclough group is donating a huge cake to feed the hungry, impoverished and entitled folk of... Sutton and Langley. This charity event is dedicated to the late Lord Naff who dedicated his life to helping those less fortunate than himself. It will be named... Clive Aid. We can speak now to the creator of the cake, Mrs Buttermuffin. Mrs Buttermuffin, would you perhaps tell us a little more about the cake itself?

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Well, it's the usual ingredients really... flour, butter, margarine, lard, chip-fat, eggs, Marmite, cream, vinegar, two types of jam... raspberry and anchovy, a little bit of sharp sand for texture, and I dust the top with a mixture of icing sugar and Shake-n-Vac.

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : And what do you use to make it rise so much?

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Baking powder???

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : I said, what do you use to make it rise so much?

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Oh! Well, that's a little secret passed down the generations. I always add 2 pints of bleach, it gives it a lovely light fluffy texture, and it helps keep my surfaces clean

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Well I must say Mrs Buttermuffin, it all sounds delicious and I'm sure the starving folk in Sutton and Langley will be very grateful for this generous donation

**_Mrs Buttermuffin_** : Oh, one more thing, it will be stored in my pantry overnight to make sure no-one can steal it. That's very important... It will be left in the pantry, for safekeeping. In... The... Pantry...

**_Roxy Belmeadows_** : Well there you have it, just time for a quick look at tomorrow's papers. The Times goes with, "Cake will be in pantry". The Telegraph says "Pantry contains cake" and also an in-depth piece on the Rod Stewart Pothole. The Guardian leads with "Cake-Gate cover-up" and finally, The Sun, "Cor, what a whopper!"... a picture of the cake there. That's all from me on the day we learned that the cake will be in the pantry.

# Mission Not Possible

- Freddie and Mrs Buttermuffin wheel the cake in and set the alarms
- Gideon descends from the ceiling to try to get to the cake.
