# Planet Of The Dames - Characters

**Captain Dan Cassanova** Likeable rogue/spiv/scoundrel. A combination of Johnny Depp's character in Pirates of The Caribbean, a bit of Harrison Ford (Han Solo in Star Wars), a bit of Rik Mayal's "Lord Flashheart" from Black Adder, and just a sprinkle of Leslie Phillips (Ding Dong).

**Dames** (between 1 and 4 depending on logistics, casting etc). One of them may be one of the kids. Suggested names: Florence, Beatrice, Gertrude, Amelia - each has their own characteristics but essentially, they're all panto-dames

**Igor** A Servant. Perhaps a kid in hooded cape? Only features in Act 1 Scene 1. Looks after the Dames (e.g. orders make up for them). Is also a Spy for the good-guys (i.e. The Jedi)

**Princess Layabout** Suey's older sister, ridculous hair (like Princess Leia in Star Wars, think danish pastries on each ear), lazy, maybe wears a white onesie, scouse twang.

**Dame Bots** (2 kids) They are part human, part robot. They are the Dame's military wing. Camouflage dresses?? Wigs (maybe blue), guns?

**Obi Wan Big Bogie** Looks like Obi One Kenobie (from Star Wars). Alec Guiness (sort of) voice, Jedi-master, wise sage, brown hooded cape.

**Mr Suey** The same character as last year, dressed the same. Has married Calamity. A bit henpecked at the start but maybe changes as he goes on his journey

**Calamity** Never seen, henpecking off stage

**Courtney** Slightly incompetent teenager, trainee pilot/assistanct to Obi Wan Big Bogie. Socially inept, not very interested in anything. Greasy fringe. Wearing ill fitting suit (his dad's) with pokemon t-shirt and baseball cap???

**Ken** Retired, in his 70s, know-it-all, doesn't have much time for younger people or more modern social norms. Into geology and everything else, Might wear socks and suspenders, last of summer wine vibe. May also wear one-piece "Damart" thermal underwear.

**Dorothy** Similar age to Ken, ex-teacher, Mary Quant-esque or maybe slight hippy tendencies, more rebelious, socialist, worked for avon in the 80s, still very trendy, does make up tips on tik tok under the brand "Juicy" and tries to educate her peers

**Bearass** Bear Grylls type character, wannabe action man, got all the gadgets, thinks he could have been in the SAS but actually is a tour-guide at the Blue John Caverns. Maybe has a lisp. His father was Spanish. Short shorts, ropes etc

**Pete** The only other prisoner on the Planet Farton. An activist, founded Just Stop Dames, the protest group of which he is currently the only member. Idolises the Jedi, particularly Obi Wan Big Bogie. Could be a female part if that works better for available cast.

**Debra** Pink Octopus!!! (I know). May have an Italian accent, she runs the Flash Bar Stores which is probably a front for all sorts of dubious trades and activities.

**WD40** Sidekick robot to Dan Cassanova. Like R2D2 from Star Wars. Doesn't suffer fools (i.e. non-robots), can get angry and swears by bleeping.

**Aliens** Cardboard box aliens - background parts, make noises
